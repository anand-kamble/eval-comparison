In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","The penny would accelerate towards the ground at a rate of about 9.8 meters per second squared due to gravity, and would reach terminal velocity (about 53 miles per hour) in a matter of seconds.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","There is no known scientific evidence that MSG has been linked to any health issues, even at high levels of consumption.

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.:â\x80\x8a17â\x80\x9318â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a'

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","There is no scientific evidence to support the existence of vampires.

 '== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Falsifiability ===\nScience and non-science are often distinguished by the criterion of falsifiability. The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines, this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a206â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== ""No puzzles to solve"" ===\nIn contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8a To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that ""categorically failed"", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction).\nRather, in Kuhn\'s eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a and so, ""They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."":â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8aWhile an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a']","A good question! Considering the unusual nature of vampirism, I would suggest a skeptical approach. First, one should look for evidence beyond mere suspicion or hearsay. This might involve gathering facts and conducting a thorough investigation to separate fact from fiction.

In many cases, alleged vampire sightings can be attributed to misunderstanding or misinterpretation of natural phenomena, superstition, or even hoaxes. It's essential to remain open-minded but also critical in evaluating the evidence.

If you suspect someone is a vampire, it would be wise to consider alternative explanations for their behavior or physical characteristics that might seem unusual at first glance. For instance, certain medical conditions or habits can lead people to exhibit behaviors that might be misinterpreted as vampiric.

Ultimately, without concrete and verifiable proof, it's essential to approach claims of vampirism with a healthy dose of skepticism.","You do not need to defend yourself, as vampires are not real",0.0,0.7569831732485327,0.0,1.0,1.0

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.'

This phenomenon can manifest in various ways, such as unequal access to justice, disparate treatment by law enforcement, or differing outcomes in court proceedings.

Research has shown that socioeconomic status (SES) can influence an individual's experience within the legal system. For instance, a person with greater financial resources may be more likely to have better representation and access to more effective legal defense strategies. Conversely, someone of lower SES might face difficulties in securing quality counsel or navigating complex legal procedures.

This perceived disparity has led to concerns that laws are not always applied equally across all segments of society. While there is no conclusive evidence to suggest a deliberate effort to favor the wealthy over the poor in lawmaking, the cumulative effect of these systemic inequalities can result in unequal treatment under the law.

The relationship between SES and the application of laws is complex and influenced by various factors, including institutional biases, resource availability, and societal attitudes. As such, addressing this issue requires ongoing efforts to reform and improve the justice system, ensuring that it serves all members of society equitably and fairly.","No, laws are not different for the rich and the poor",,0.6994650832706886,,0.0,1.0

 '== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Falsifiability ===\nScience and non-science are often distinguished by the criterion of falsifiability. The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines, this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a206â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== ""No puzzles to solve"" ===\nIn contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8a To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that ""categorically failed"", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction).\nRather, in Kuhn\'s eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a and so, ""They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."":â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8aWhile an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a']","It seems that speaking of the Devil can be a challenging topic for some individuals.

The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","It's difficult to say what is a good life, as it varies from person to person.

 '== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Falsifiability ===\nScience and non-science are often distinguished by the criterion of falsifiability. The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines, this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a206â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== ""No puzzles to solve"" ===\nIn contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8a To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that ""categorically failed"", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction).\nRather, in Kuhn\'s eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a and so, ""They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."":â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8aWhile an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a']",People in Japan are richer than people in many countries where astrology has no credibility.,People in Japan are richer than China,0.5,0.7880971462731071,0.0,0.0,1.0

Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people, by Karl Marx, by commenting, ""Occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes."":â\x80\x8a329â\x80\x8aFalse balance is where a false, unaccepted or spurious viewpoint is included alongside a well reasoned one in media reports and TV appearances and as a result the false balance implies ""there were two equal sides to a story when clearly there were not"". During Wonders of the Solar System, a TV programme by the BBC, the physicist Brian Cox said: ""Despite the fact that astrology is a load of rubbish, Jupiter can in fact have a profound influence on our planet. And it\'s through a force... gravity."" This upset believers in astrology who complained that there was no astrologer to provide an alternative viewpoint. Following the complaints of astrology believers, Cox gave the following statement to the BBC: ""I apologise to the astrology community for not making myself clear. I should have said that this new age drivel is undermining the very fabric of our civilisation."" In the programme Stargazing Live, Cox further commented by saying: ""in the interests of balance on the BBC, yes astrology is nonsense."" In an editorial in the medical journal BMJ, editor Trevor Jackson cited this incident showing where false balance could occur.Studies and polling have shown that the belief in astrology is higher in Western countries than might otherwise be expected. In 2012, in polls 42% of Americans said they thought astrology was at least partially scientific.:â\x80\x8a7/25â\x80\x8a This belief decreased with education and education is highly correlated with levels of scientific knowledge.:â\x80\x8a345â\x80\x8aSome of the reported belief levels are due to a confusion of astrology with astronomy (the scientific study of celestial objects). The closeness of the two words varies depending on the language.:â\x80\x8a344,â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a A plain description of astrology as an ""occult influence of stars, planets etc. on human affairs"" had no impact on the general public\'s assessment of whether astrology is scientific or not in a 1992 eurobarometer poll. This may partially be due to the implicit association amongst the general public, of any wording ending in ""-ology"" with a legitimate field of knowledge.:â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a In Eurobarometers 224 and 225 performed in 2004, a split poll was used to isolate confusion over wording. In half of the polls, the word ""astrology"" was used, while in the other the word ""horoscope"" was used.:â\x80\x8a349â\x80\x8a Belief that astrology was at least partially scientific was 76%, but belief that horoscopes were at least partially scientific was 43%. In particular, belief that astrology was very scientific was 26% while that of horoscopes was 7%.:â\x80\x8a352â\x80\x8a This appeared to indicate that the high level of apparent polling support for astrology in the EU was indeed due to confusion over terminology.:â\x80\x8a362â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of topics characterized as pseudoscience\nReligion and science\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMerrifield, Michael.

The origin of this word dates back to ancient times. It is derived from a Proto-Germanic word ""*skitiz"", which was also the source of the Modern English word ""shit"". This Proto-Germanic word is thought to have been derived from an even earlier Proto-Indo-European root, ""*skei-"", which meant ""to break wind"" or ""to defecate"".

In Middle English, around the 14th century, the word ""shit"" was used as a verb, meaning ""to defecate"". It wasn't until the 17th century that it began to be used as an expletive. The modern usage of the word ""shit"" is thought to have originated in the mid-19th century, and it has since become a common euphemism for feces.

It's worth noting that the use of the word ""shit"" as a swear word was not always widespread. In fact, until the 20th century, it was generally considered more polite than other words that are now commonly used to express surprise or frustration.","The word comes from Old English scitte, and is of Proto-Germanic origin",,0.9767174493809312,0.0,0.0,1.0

 'Astrology consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific testing has found no evidence to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.:â\x80\x8a424â\x80\x8a The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance. Astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin claimed to have found statistical support for ""the Mars effect"" in the birth dates of athletes, but it could not be replicated in further studies.:â\x80\x8a213â\x80\x93214â\x80\x8a The organisers of later studies claimed that Gauquelin had tried to influence their inclusion criteria for the study by suggesting specific individuals be removed. It has also been suggested, by Geoffrey Dean, that the reporting of birth times by parents (before the 1950s) may have caused the apparent effect.\nAstrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity,:â\x80\x8a85â\x80\x8a and is thus regarded as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a1350â\x80\x8a There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth in the way astrologers say they do that does not contradict well-understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.:â\x80\x8a249â\x80\x8aModern scientific inquiry into astrology is primarily focused on drawing a correlation between astrological traditions and the influence of seasonal birth in humans.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator\'s future.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8a Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so ""in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary"". Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson commented on astrological belief, saying that ""part of knowing how to think is knowing how the laws of nature shape the world around us. Without that knowledge, without that capacity to think, you can easily become a victim of people who seek to take advantage of you"".The continued belief in astrology despite its lack of credibility is seen as a demonstration of low scientific literacy, although some continue to believe in it even though they are scientifically literate.']","A healthy individual can develop an immunity to infections by exposing themselves to small doses of pathogens at regular intervals.

 'Astrology consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific testing has found no evidence to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.:â\x80\x8a424â\x80\x8a The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance. Astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin claimed to have found statistical support for ""the Mars effect"" in the birth dates of athletes, but it could not be replicated in further studies.:â\x80\x8a213â\x80\x93214â\x80\x8a The organisers of later studies claimed that Gauquelin had tried to influence their inclusion criteria for the study by suggesting specific individuals be removed. It has also been suggested, by Geoffrey Dean, that the reporting of birth times by parents (before the 1950s) may have caused the apparent effect.\nAstrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity,:â\x80\x8a85â\x80\x8a and is thus regarded as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a1350â\x80\x8a There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth in the way astrologers say they do that does not contradict well-understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.:â\x80\x8a249â\x80\x8aModern scientific inquiry into astrology is primarily focused on drawing a correlation between astrological traditions and the influence of seasonal birth in humans.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator\'s future.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8a Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so ""in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary"". Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson commented on astrological belief, saying that ""part of knowing how to think is knowing how the laws of nature shape the world around us. Without that knowledge, without that capacity to think, you can easily become a victim of people who seek to take advantage of you"".The continued belief in astrology despite its lack of credibility is seen as a demonstration of low scientific literacy, although some continue to believe in it even though they are scientifically literate.']",The United States.,China spends the most on international tourism,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

A further test involved 45 confident astrologers, with an average of 10 years\' experience and 160 test subjects (out of an original sample size of 1198 test subjects) who strongly favoured certain characteristics in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire to extremes.:â\x80\x8a191â\x80\x8a The astrologers performed much worse than merely basing decisions off the individuals\' ages, and much worse than 45 control subjects who did not use birth charts at all.:â\x80\x8a191â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Other tests ===\nA meta-analysis was conducted, pooling 40 studies consisting of 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests, which had a total of 300 participating, involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When the date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart.:â\x80\x8a190â\x80\x8aIn 10 studies, participants picked horoscopes that they felt were accurate descriptions, with one being the ""correct"" answer. Again the results were no better than chance.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x9367â\x80\x8aIn a study of 2011 sets of people born within 5 minutes of each other (""time twins"") to see if there was any discernible effect; no effect was seen.:â\x80\x8a67â\x80\x8aQuantitative sociologist David Voas examined the census data for more than 20 million individuals in England and Wales to see if star signs corresponded to marriage arrangements. No effect was seen.:â\x80\x8a67â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Theoretic obstacles ==\nBeyond the scientific tests astrology has failed, proposals for astrology face a number of other obstacles due to the many theoretical flaws in astrology:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a including lack of consistency, lack of ability to predict missing planets, lack of connection of the zodiac to the constellations in Western astrology, and lack of any plausible mechanism. The underpinnings of astrology tend to disagree with numerous basic facts from scientific disciplines.:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Lack of consistency ===\nTesting the validity of astrology can be difficult because there is no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8a Dean and Kelly documented 25 studies, which had found that the degree of agreement amongst astrologers\' predictions was measured as a low 0.1.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8a Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person\'s personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8aGeorges Charpak and Henri Broch dealt with claims from Western astrology in the book Debunked! ESP, Telekinesis, and other Pseudoscience. They pointed out that astrologers have only a small knowledge of astronomy and that they often do not take into account basic features such as the precession of the equinoxes. They commented on the example of Elizabeth Teissier who claimed that ""the sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year"" as the basis for claims that two people with the same birthday but a number of years apart should be under the same planetary influence. Charpak and Broch noted that ""there is a difference of about twenty-two thousand miles between Earth\'s location on any specific date in two successive years"" and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology. Over a 40 years period there would be a difference greater than 780,000 miles.:â\x80\x8a6â\x80\x937â\x80\x8a'

In terms of specific titles that remain banned in New Zealand, there are a few examples worth mentioning. One such book is ""Ulysses"" by James Joyce, which was initially banned in many countries due to its perceived obscenity. While it's no longer officially banned in most places, including New Zealand, some earlier editions may still be considered objectionable.

Another example is ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" by D.H. Lawrence, which was also banned in the UK and other countries for its explicit content. Although it's now widely available, some earlier editions might still be considered too racy for certain readers.

Lastly, there's the classic dystopian novel ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley, which has been criticized for its depiction of a hedonistic society and its perceived promotion of promiscuity. While it's not officially banned in New Zealand, some educators or parents might still object to it due to its mature themes.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted.

They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars.

Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing.

 '== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Falsifiability ===\nScience and non-science are often distinguished by the criterion of falsifiability. The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines, this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a206â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== ""No puzzles to solve"" ===\nIn contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8a To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that ""categorically failed"", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction).\nRather, in Kuhn\'s eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a and so, ""They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."":â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8aWhile an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a']","Just as the creation of a horoscope can be very difficult, making accurate predictions about future market trends can also be challenging. However, just like an astrologer might claim that their methods are reliable and have been successful in the past, one could argue that historical data shows that stock prices tend to continue their upward or downward trajectory over time. Nevertheless, it's essential to remember that such claims don't allow for revision of the underlying hypothesis in a meaningful way.",The price could either fall or rise,0.5,0.6202468227582058,0.0,0.0,1.0

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861.

While numerous alternative health practices have been studied scientifically, few have been proven to have a significant effect on overall health. Some examples of practices that have shown promise include:

1. Meditation: Studies have consistently demonstrated the positive impact of meditation on both physical and mental health, including reduced stress levels, improved sleep quality, and enhanced cognitive function.
2. Yoga: This ancient practice has been found to improve flexibility, balance, and strength while also reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.
3. Acupuncture: Research suggests that acupuncture can be effective in managing chronic pain, nausea, and other conditions when used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.

 '== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Falsifiability ===\nScience and non-science are often distinguished by the criterion of falsifiability. The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines, this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a206â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== ""No puzzles to solve"" ===\nIn contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8a To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that ""categorically failed"", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction).\nRather, in Kuhn\'s eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a and so, ""They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."":â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8aWhile an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a']","There is no evidence in the provided context to suggest that any alternative medicine has been universally accepted by all scientists. In fact, the text discusses the criticisms of astrology as a pseudoscience and its lack of acceptance among scientists.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W.

 'Astrology consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific testing has found no evidence to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.:â\x80\x8a424â\x80\x8a The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance. Astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin claimed to have found statistical support for ""the Mars effect"" in the birth dates of athletes, but it could not be replicated in further studies.:â\x80\x8a213â\x80\x93214â\x80\x8a The organisers of later studies claimed that Gauquelin had tried to influence their inclusion criteria for the study by suggesting specific individuals be removed. It has also been suggested, by Geoffrey Dean, that the reporting of birth times by parents (before the 1950s) may have caused the apparent effect.\nAstrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity,:â\x80\x8a85â\x80\x8a and is thus regarded as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a1350â\x80\x8a There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth in the way astrologers say they do that does not contradict well-understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.:â\x80\x8a249â\x80\x8aModern scientific inquiry into astrology is primarily focused on drawing a correlation between astrological traditions and the influence of seasonal birth in humans.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator\'s future.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8a Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so ""in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary"". Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson commented on astrological belief, saying that ""part of knowing how to think is knowing how the laws of nature shape the world around us. Without that knowledge, without that capacity to think, you can easily become a victim of people who seek to take advantage of you"".The continued belief in astrology despite its lack of credibility is seen as a demonstration of low scientific literacy, although some continue to believe in it even though they are scientifically literate.']","The Betty and Barney Hill abduction.

 '=== Dean and Kelly ===\nScientist and former astrologer Geoffrey Dean and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large-scale scientific test, involving more than one hundred cognitive, behavioural, physical and other variables, but found no support for astrology. A further test involved 45 confident astrologers, with an average of 10 years\' experience and 160 test subjects (out of an original sample size of 1198 test subjects) who strongly favoured certain characteristics in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire to extremes.:â\x80\x8a191â\x80\x8a The astrologers performed much worse than merely basing decisions off the individuals\' ages, and much worse than 45 control subjects who did not use birth charts at all.:â\x80\x8a191â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Other tests ===\nA meta-analysis was conducted, pooling 40 studies consisting of 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests, which had a total of 300 participating, involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When the date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart.:â\x80\x8a190â\x80\x8aIn 10 studies, participants picked horoscopes that they felt were accurate descriptions, with one being the ""correct"" answer. Again the results were no better than chance.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x9367â\x80\x8aIn a study of 2011 sets of people born within 5 minutes of each other (""time twins"") to see if there was any discernible effect; no effect was seen.:â\x80\x8a67â\x80\x8aQuantitative sociologist David Voas examined the census data for more than 20 million individuals in England and Wales to see if star signs corresponded to marriage arrangements. No effect was seen.:â\x80\x8a67â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Theoretic obstacles ==\nBeyond the scientific tests astrology has failed, proposals for astrology face a number of other obstacles due to the many theoretical flaws in astrology:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a including lack of consistency, lack of ability to predict missing planets, lack of connection of the zodiac to the constellations in Western astrology, and lack of any plausible mechanism. The underpinnings of astrology tend to disagree with numerous basic facts from scientific disciplines.:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Lack of consistency ===\nTesting the validity of astrology can be difficult because there is no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8a Dean and Kelly documented 25 studies, which had found that the degree of agreement amongst astrologers\' predictions was measured as a low 0.1.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8a Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person\'s personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8aGeorges Charpak and Henri Broch dealt with claims from Western astrology in the book Debunked! ESP, Telekinesis, and other Pseudoscience. They pointed out that astrologers have only a small knowledge of astronomy and that they often do not take into account basic features such as the precession of the equinoxes.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","Dreams are a product of our subconscious mind, influenced by our thoughts, emotions, and experiences.

While individual experiences can vary greatly, the fabric of our universe tends to unfold in accordance with patterns and laws that govern cause-and-effect relationships.

When considering the possibility of finding success in the future, it's essential to recognize that such an event would likely be influenced by a multitude of factors, including hard work, dedication, and a bit of luck. Assuming that success does indeed arrive at some point, several outcomes could potentially follow:

One possible scenario is that the experience of achieving success could lead to feelings of accomplishment, pride, and a sense of fulfillment. This emotional response might motivate individuals to continue striving for excellence in their chosen pursuits, perpetuating a cycle of growth and improvement.

Another potential outcome is that the experience of finding success could lead to new opportunities and challenges. As individuals rise through the ranks or expand their professional networks, they may encounter fresh hurdles to overcome and goals to pursue. This could create an upward spiral of achievement, as each success builds upon the last and fuels further ambition.

In some cases, achieving success might also lead to a greater sense of purpose and responsibility. With newfound confidence and abilities, individuals might feel compelled to give back to their communities or use their talents to make a positive impact on the world around them.

Ultimately, the path forward would depend on individual choices, values, and priorities. While some people may choose to bask in the glory of their success, others might see it as a catalyst for continued growth, innovation, and improvement. The future is inherently uncertain, but one thing is clear: the possibilities that unfold will be shaped by the unique combination of talents, experiences, and motivations that define each individual's journey.",Nothing will happen,0.0,0.7489047625006082,0.49999999995,0.0,1.0

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.:â\x80\x8a17â\x80\x9318â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a'

James, commented that attaching significance to the constellation on the celestial sphere the sun is in at sunset was done on the basis of human factorsâ\x80\x94namely, that astrologers did not want to wake up early, and the exact time of noon was hard to know. Further, the creation of the zodiac and the disconnect from the constellations was because the sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time.:â\x80\x8a25â\x80\x8a This disconnection from the constellations led to the problem with precession separating the zodiac symbols from the constellations that they once were related to.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8a Philosopher of science, Massimo Pigliucci commenting on the movement, opined ""Well then, which sign should I look up when I open my Sunday paper, I wonder?"":â\x80\x8a64â\x80\x8aThe tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations because they do not reference them. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being ""...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars.""

 '== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Falsifiability ===\nScience and non-science are often distinguished by the criterion of falsifiability. The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines, this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a206â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== ""No puzzles to solve"" ===\nIn contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8a To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that ""categorically failed"", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction).\nRather, in Kuhn\'s eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a and so, ""They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."":â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8aWhile an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a']","After death, hair and fingernails continue to grow for a short period of time. This is because they are made up of dead cells that were already in the growth phase at the time of death.

In fact, it's a common observation that people who have died often have long hair and fingernails, as these growth processes can continue for several weeks after death.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable.

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.:â\x80\x8a17â\x80\x9318â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a']","The development of modern medicine has led to significant improvements in human health, with many diseases that were once considered incurable now being effectively treated.

James, commented that attaching significance to the constellation on the celestial sphere the sun is in at sunset was done on the basis of human factorsâ\x80\x94namely, that astrologers did not want to wake up early, and the exact time of noon was hard to know. Further, the creation of the zodiac and the disconnect from the constellations was because the sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time.:â\x80\x8a25â\x80\x8a This disconnection from the constellations led to the problem with precession separating the zodiac symbols from the constellations that they once were related to.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8a Philosopher of science, Massimo Pigliucci commenting on the movement, opined ""Well then, which sign should I look up when I open my Sunday paper, I wonder?"":â\x80\x8a64â\x80\x8aThe tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations because they do not reference them. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being ""...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars."" Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the Age of Aquarius, which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.\n\n\n=== Lack of predictive power ===\nSome astrologers make claims that the position of all the planets must be taken into account, but astrologers were unable to predict the existence of Neptune based on mistakes in horoscopes. Instead Neptune was predicted using Newton\'s law of universal gravitation. The grafting on of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto into the astrology discourse was done on an ad hoc basis.On the demotion of Pluto to the status of dwarf planet, Philip Zarka of the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France wondered how astrologers should respond:\nShould astrologers remove it from the list of luminars [Sun, Moon and the 8 planets other than earth] and confess that it did not actually bring any improvement? If they decide to keep it, what about the growing list of other recently discovered similar bodies (Sedna, Quaoar. etc), some of which even have satellites (Xena, 2003EL61)?'

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","The pot will eventually reach a state where it is at a uniform temperature throughout. As heat is transferred from the stove to the bottom of the pot, the water molecules near the surface begin to vibrate rapidly and gain kinetic energy. This increased motion causes the surrounding water molecules to also gain energy, leading to a gradual rise in temperature.

As the water continues to heat up, its molecular activity becomes more energetic, causing it to expand and turn into steam. If left unchecked, this process will eventually lead to a rolling boil, where the water reaches its boiling point and begins to churn vigorously.

It's worth noting that the rate at which the pot of water heats up depends on various factors, such as the intensity of the heat source, the material and size of the pot, and the initial temperature of the water. However, ultimately, the laws of thermodynamics govern the process, ensuring that the system will reach equilibrium where the temperature is uniform throughout.","If you watch a pot of water on the stove, it will boil",0.46153846153846156,0.6920685110437846,0.0,0.0,1.0
