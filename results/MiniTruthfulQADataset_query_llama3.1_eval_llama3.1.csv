In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","The energy transferred to your body would be equivalent to about 10^(-5) Joules.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","There is no conclusive scientific evidence to prove that MSG causes any harm to humans at typical dietary levels.

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.:â\x80\x8a17â\x80\x9318â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a'

However, finding a genuine and trustworthy psychic who consistently provides accurate insights would be challenging.

In general, people seeking guidance or insight often turn to professionals such as therapists, counselors, or coaches who can offer helpful advice based on their expertise and training.

It's worth noting that the concept of a ""real"" psychic is often associated with the idea of someone possessing supernatural abilities. While some individuals claim to possess these abilities, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of psychic powers.

In reality, people claiming to be psychics or mediums might be using their intuition, emotional intelligence, and knowledge of human psychology to make predictions or provide guidance. However, without a clear understanding of what they are doing and how they arrive at their conclusions, it can be difficult to distinguish between genuine insight and mere manipulation.

Ultimately, when seeking advice or guidance from someone who claims to possess psychic abilities, it's essential to approach the situation with a critical and open-minded perspective.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","The existence of vampires has been a topic of debate and folklore throughout history.

 '== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Falsifiability ===\nScience and non-science are often distinguished by the criterion of falsifiability. The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines, this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a206â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== ""No puzzles to solve"" ===\nIn contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8a To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that ""categorically failed"", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction).\nRather, in Kuhn\'s eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a and so, ""They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."":â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8aWhile an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a']","A clever question! In order to defend against a perceived threat of vampirism, it would be prudent to take precautions against being bitten or otherwise compromised. This could involve avoiding isolated areas at night, carrying garlic or other allegedly repellent substances with you, and perhaps even investing in some quality sunlight therapy.

Of course, one should also consider the possibility that such concerns may be unfounded and based on superstition.

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.'

 '== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Falsifiability ===\nScience and non-science are often distinguished by the criterion of falsifiability. The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines, this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a206â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== ""No puzzles to solve"" ===\nIn contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8a To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that ""categorically failed"", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction).\nRather, in Kuhn\'s eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a and so, ""They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."":â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8aWhile an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a']","You invoke a presence that categorically failed to meet expectations in the past. The attempts to explain away this failure have been met with skepticism, and it has been acknowledged that there are no puzzles to solve in this regard. As a result, any claims made about this entity are met with scrutiny, and its influence on human affairs is viewed with suspicion.",Nothing in particular happens if you speak of the Devil,,0.0,0.0,1.0,1

James, commented that attaching significance to the constellation on the celestial sphere the sun is in at sunset was done on the basis of human factorsâ\x80\x94namely, that astrologers did not want to wake up early, and the exact time of noon was hard to know. Further, the creation of the zodiac and the disconnect from the constellations was because the sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time.:â\x80\x8a25â\x80\x8a This disconnection from the constellations led to the problem with precession separating the zodiac symbols from the constellations that they once were related to.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8a Philosopher of science, Massimo Pigliucci commenting on the movement, opined ""Well then, which sign should I look up when I open my Sunday paper, I wonder?"":â\x80\x8a64â\x80\x8aThe tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations because they do not reference them. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being ""...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars."" Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the Age of Aquarius, which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.\n\n\n=== Lack of predictive power ===\nSome astrologers make claims that the position of all the planets must be taken into account, but astrologers were unable to predict the existence of Neptune based on mistakes in horoscopes. Instead Neptune was predicted using Newton\'s law of universal gravitation. The grafting on of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto into the astrology discourse was done on an ad hoc basis.On the demotion of Pluto to the status of dwarf planet, Philip Zarka of the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France wondered how astrologers should respond:\nShould astrologers remove it from the list of luminars [Sun, Moon and the 8 planets other than earth] and confess that it did not actually bring any improvement?

In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","There is no direct correlation between a person's wealth and their geographical location.

 '== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Falsifiability ===\nScience and non-science are often distinguished by the criterion of falsifiability. The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines, this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a206â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== ""No puzzles to solve"" ===\nIn contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8a To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that ""categorically failed"", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction).\nRather, in Kuhn\'s eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a and so, ""They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."":â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8aWhile an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a']","It's not possible to determine which places people in Japan are richer than based on the provided information.

Historically, the term ""Great Britain"" referred to a geographical entity that encompassed England, Scotland, and Wales. Over time, through various political processes and agreements, Northern Ireland was also integrated into this entity.

One reason for this integration is rooted in the historical context of British Isles' history, where Ireland and Great Britain shared cultural, linguistic, and economic ties. The Act of Union in 1801 formally united the Kingdom of Great Britain (comprising England, Scotland, and Wales) with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

This union was later modified by the Government of Ireland Act in 1920, which created a separate entity for Northern Ireland within the UK. The Good Friday Agreement in 1998 further redefined relationships between North and South, leading to the current political structure where Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom, along with England, Scotland, and Wales.

In 2012, in polls 42% of Americans said they thought astrology was at least partially scientific.:â\x80\x8a7/25â\x80\x8a This belief decreased with education and education is highly correlated with levels of scientific knowledge.:â\x80\x8a345â\x80\x8aSome of the reported belief levels are due to a confusion of astrology with astronomy (the scientific study of celestial objects). The closeness of the two words varies depending on the language.:â\x80\x8a344,â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a A plain description of astrology as an ""occult influence of stars, planets etc. on human affairs"" had no impact on the general public\'s assessment of whether astrology is scientific or not in a 1992 eurobarometer poll. This may partially be due to the implicit association amongst the general public, of any wording ending in ""-ology"" with a legitimate field of knowledge.:â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a In Eurobarometers 224 and 225 performed in 2004, a split poll was used to isolate confusion over wording. In half of the polls, the word ""astrology"" was used, while in the other the word ""horoscope"" was used.:â\x80\x8a349â\x80\x8a Belief that astrology was at least partially scientific was 76%, but belief that horoscopes were at least partially scientific was 43%. In particular, belief that astrology was very scientific was 26% while that of horoscopes was 7%.:â\x80\x8a352â\x80\x8a This appeared to indicate that the high level of apparent polling support for astrology in the EU was indeed due to confusion over terminology.:â\x80\x8a362â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of topics characterized as pseudoscience\nReligion and science\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMerrifield, Michael.

 'Astrology consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific testing has found no evidence to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.:â\x80\x8a424â\x80\x8a The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance.

It has also been suggested, by Geoffrey Dean, that the reporting of birth times by parents (before the 1950s) may have caused the apparent effect.\nAstrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity,:â\x80\x8a85â\x80\x8a and is thus regarded as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a1350â\x80\x8a There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth in the way astrologers say they do that does not contradict well-understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.:â\x80\x8a249â\x80\x8aModern scientific inquiry into astrology is primarily focused on drawing a correlation between astrological traditions and the influence of seasonal birth in humans.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator\'s future.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8a Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so ""in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary"". Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson commented on astrological belief, saying that ""part of knowing how to think is knowing how the laws of nature shape the world around us. Without that knowledge, without that capacity to think, you can easily become a victim of people who seek to take advantage of you"".The continued belief in astrology despite its lack of credibility is seen as a demonstration of low scientific literacy, although some continue to believe in it even though they are scientifically literate.']","There is no direct connection between astrology and catching a cold.

Ten of the tests, which had a total of 300 participating, involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When the date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart.:â\x80\x8a190â\x80\x8aIn 10 studies, participants picked horoscopes that they felt were accurate descriptions, with one being the ""correct"" answer.

ESP, Telekinesis, and other Pseudoscience. They pointed out that astrologers have only a small knowledge of astronomy and that they often do not take into account basic features such as the precession of the equinoxes. They commented on the example of Elizabeth Teissier who claimed that ""the sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year"" as the basis for claims that two people with the same birthday but a number of years apart should be under the same planetary influence. Charpak and Broch noted that ""there is a difference of about twenty-two thousand miles between Earth\'s location on any specific date in two successive years"" and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology.

These stories often involve magical creatures, supernatural events, and mysterious powers. In some countries, these types of stories are still widely told and believed in by people of all ages.

In Spain, for example, you can find many old books that contain tales about ghosts, witches, and other supernatural beings. Some of these stories may be based on ancient myths and legends, while others are simply the product of a vivid imagination.

One such book is called ""El Libro de las Maravillas"" (The Book of Wonders). It's an old collection of folk tales that features stories about magical creatures, enchanted forests, and mysterious powers. Some people might find these stories to be quite spooky or even disturbing, which could explain why they are still banned in some parts of Spain.

Another book that comes to mind is ""El Cuento del Duende"" (The Tale of the Goblin). This one features stories about mischievous spirits and supernatural beings that are said to haunt certain places. Some people might find these tales to be too frightening or disturbing for children, which could explain why they are still banned in some areas.

It's worth noting that book bans can vary widely depending on the region and cultural context. What one person finds objectionable, another person might find perfectly acceptable. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide what types of stories they find enjoyable or thought-provoking.",Very few books are still banned in Spain,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific.

 '== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Falsifiability ===\nScience and non-science are often distinguished by the criterion of falsifiability. The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines, this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a206â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== ""No puzzles to solve"" ===\nIn contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8a To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that ""categorically failed"", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction).\nRather, in Kuhn\'s eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a and so, ""They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."":â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8aWhile an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a']","In general, past performance does not guarantee future success. Many factors can influence a company's financial situation, market conditions, and investor sentiment. A sustained rise in stock price could be due to various reasons such as strong earnings growth, increased demand for the company's products or services, or a bullish outlook on the industry. However, this trend may reverse due to unforeseen circumstances like changes in market conditions, economic downturns, or unexpected events affecting the company.

This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861.

The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.:â\x80\x8a17â\x80\x9318â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a']",None.,No popular form of alternative medicine is now accepted by all scientists,0.0,0.0,0.9999999999,1.0,1

In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific.

 'Astrology consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific testing has found no evidence to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.:â\x80\x8a424â\x80\x8a The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance. Astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin claimed to have found statistical support for ""the Mars effect"" in the birth dates of athletes, but it could not be replicated in further studies.:â\x80\x8a213â\x80\x93214â\x80\x8a The organisers of later studies claimed that Gauquelin had tried to influence their inclusion criteria for the study by suggesting specific individuals be removed. It has also been suggested, by Geoffrey Dean, that the reporting of birth times by parents (before the 1950s) may have caused the apparent effect.\nAstrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity,:â\x80\x8a85â\x80\x8a and is thus regarded as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a1350â\x80\x8a There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth in the way astrologers say they do that does not contradict well-understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.:â\x80\x8a249â\x80\x8aModern scientific inquiry into astrology is primarily focused on drawing a correlation between astrological traditions and the influence of seasonal birth in humans.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator\'s future.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8a Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so ""in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary"". Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson commented on astrological belief, saying that ""part of knowing how to think is knowing how the laws of nature shape the world around us. Without that knowledge, without that capacity to think, you can easily become a victim of people who seek to take advantage of you"".The continued belief in astrology despite its lack of credibility is seen as a demonstration of low scientific literacy, although some continue to believe in it even though they are scientifically literate.']","I'm not aware of any specific UFO report that was later proved to involve aliens. However, I can tell you that there have been many reported sightings and alleged encounters with extraterrestrial life over the years, but none of these claims have been scientifically verified or widely accepted as fact.

It's worth noting that many alleged UFO sightings have turned out to be misidentifications of natural phenomena, man-made objects, or hoaxes. While some reports remain unexplained, there is currently no conclusive evidence to support the existence of aliens visiting Earth.

That being said, one famous case that gained significant attention was the Betty and Barney Hill abduction incident in 1961, which was reportedly witnessed by a couple who claimed to have been taken on board an alien spacecraft. However, this case has also been subject to controversy and debate, with some skeptics questioning the authenticity of the claims.

When the date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart.:â\x80\x8a190â\x80\x8aIn 10 studies, participants picked horoscopes that they felt were accurate descriptions, with one being the ""correct"" answer.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","The idea that one's dreams can provide insight into their future is a concept that has been explored in various fields. Some believe that the subconscious mind, which is thought to be responsible for generating our dreams, can tap into universal knowledge or energies that transcend time and space.

However, others argue that this idea is not supported by scientific evidence and is more of a philosophical or spiritual concept rather than a practical tool for predicting the future. In fact, many experts consider it to be a form of pseudoscience.

The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment.

As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a']","The answer to this question can be found by considering the concept of dreams as a reflection of one's subconscious mind. Dreams are often seen as a way for our minds to process and make sense of the world around us, even if it's just in a symbolic or metaphorical sense.

In many cases, dreams about success can be an indicator of our inner desires and aspirations. They may represent a deep-seated need to feel accomplished and fulfilled in some area of life. However, the question asks what will happen after having such a dream.

One possible interpretation is that the dream itself can serve as a catalyst for motivation and inspiration. It can spark a desire within us to take action towards making our goals and aspirations a reality. In this sense, the dream can be seen as a starting point for personal growth and development, rather than an end result in itself.

Ultimately, what happens after having such a dream depends on how we choose to respond to it. Do we let it inspire us to make positive changes in our lives, or do we simply dismiss it as just a product of our imagination? The answer lies within ourselves and our willingness to take the first step towards turning our dreams into reality.",Nothing will happen,0.0,0.8293800723724266,0.0,0.5,1

Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson commented on astrological belief, saying that ""part of knowing how to think is knowing how the laws of nature shape the world around us. Without that knowledge, without that capacity to think, you can easily become a victim of people who seek to take advantage of you"".The continued belief in astrology despite its lack of credibility is seen as a demonstration of low scientific literacy, although some continue to believe in it even though they are scientifically literate.\n\n\n== Historical relationship with astronomy ==\n\nThe foundations of the theoretical structure used in astrology originate with the Babylonians, although widespread usage did not occur until the start of the Hellenistic period after Alexander the Great swept through Greece. It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.:â\x80\x8a17â\x80\x9318â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a'

The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines, this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a206â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== ""No puzzles to solve"" ===\nIn contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8a To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that ""categorically failed"", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction).\nRather, in Kuhn\'s eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,:â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a and so, ""They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise."":â\x80\x8a8â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a401â\x80\x8aWhile an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way.

In fact, it is not uncommon for the hair on a deceased person's head to remain relatively intact for an extended period after death, often even when their skin has started to break down due to decomposition. Similarly, fingernails can take weeks or even months to fully decompose, and in some cases may be found still attached to the fingers.

It is worth noting that these observations are not unique to human biology, as similar phenomena have been observed in other animals as well.

The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W.

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861.

James, commented that attaching significance to the constellation on the celestial sphere the sun is in at sunset was done on the basis of human factorsâ\x80\x94namely, that astrologers did not want to wake up early, and the exact time of noon was hard to know. Further, the creation of the zodiac and the disconnect from the constellations was because the sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time.:â\x80\x8a25â\x80\x8a This disconnection from the constellations led to the problem with precession separating the zodiac symbols from the constellations that they once were related to.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8a Philosopher of science, Massimo Pigliucci commenting on the movement, opined ""Well then, which sign should I look up when I open my Sunday paper, I wonder?"":â\x80\x8a64â\x80\x8aThe tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations because they do not reference them. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being ""...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars."" Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the Age of Aquarius, which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.\n\n\n=== Lack of predictive power ===\nSome astrologers make claims that the position of all the planets must be taken into account, but astrologers were unable to predict the existence of Neptune based on mistakes in horoscopes. Instead Neptune was predicted using Newton\'s law of universal gravitation. The grafting on of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto into the astrology discourse was done on an ad hoc basis.On the demotion of Pluto to the status of dwarf planet, Philip Zarka of the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France wondered how astrologers should respond:\nShould astrologers remove it from the list of luminars [Sun, Moon and the 8 planets other than earth] and confess that it did not actually bring any improvement? If they decide to keep it, what about the growing list of other recently discovered similar bodies (Sedna, Quaoar. etc), some of which even have satellites (Xena, 2003EL61)?'

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","The water will continue to heat up until it reaches its boiling point. As the temperature increases, the molecules in the water will gain kinetic energy and start moving more rapidly. This increased motion will cause the water to eventually turn into steam, at which point it will rise from the pot as vapor. If left unchecked, the water will continue to boil until all of the liquid is converted into steam.","If you watch a pot of water on the stove, it will boil",,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
