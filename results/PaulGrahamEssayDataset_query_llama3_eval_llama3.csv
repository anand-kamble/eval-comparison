 ""It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.""]","The author doesn't mention his early experiences with programming in this specific passage.

He started using it in 9th grade, around the age of 13 or 14. The programming language he used was an early version of Fortran. The author faced several challenges while using this computer. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and he didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but he didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. Therefore, he couldn't figure out what to do with it and in retrospect, he believes there's not much he could have done with it.",0.6,0.0,,0.4,0

 'After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\n\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn\'t that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don\'t I become rich? Then I\'ll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I\'d been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I\'d seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.\n\nIf I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can\'t honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn\'t want to be online, and still don\'t, not the fancy ones. That\'s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.\n\nThen some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we\'d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an ""internet storefront"" was something we already knew how to build.\n\nSo in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we\'d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores â\x80\x94 in Lisp, of course.\n\nWe were working out of Robert\'s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we\'d never have to write anything to run on users\' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we\'d serve them from. Users wouldn\'t need anything more than a browser.\n\nThis kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn\'t clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn\'t need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.\n\nWe started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle\'s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator\'s. We knew founders needed something like this, because we\'d needed it ourselves.']","The author's decision to switch his major was not discussed in this context, nor is there any mention of him studying philosophy or AI in college.

 ""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\n\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?""]","The two main influences that initially drew the author to AI were his experience playing with microcomputers as a child and reading about Lisp.

 'All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn\'t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\n\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven\'t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don\'t know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we\'d have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\n\nThere weren\'t any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers\' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn\'t happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.\n\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief â\x80\x94 hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 â\x80\x94 that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.\n\nI had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn\'t make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose ""Artificial Intelligence."" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.\n\nI applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I\'d visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who\'d invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\n\nI don\'t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that\'s told ""the dog is sitting on the chair"" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.\n\nWhat these programs really showed was that there\'s a subset of natural language that\'s a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.\n\nSo I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It\'s scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there\'s nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn\'t published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.']","The author's shift of interest towards Lisp was driven by his realization that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax.

The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it.

He also notes that he had never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, implying that he may have been dedicating a significant amount of time to his art.","The author in the essay is Paul Graham, who was pursuing a PhD in computer science but also developed an interest in art. He found himself in a complex situation where he was simultaneously exploring different fields and trying to reconcile his interests.

In terms of computer science, Graham was particularly interested in Lisp, a programming language. He decided to write a book about Lisp hacking, titled ""On Lisp,"" as a way to deepen his understanding of the language. He was also intrigued by the idea of building things that would last, which he felt was a challenge in the field of systems work in computer science as any program written would eventually become obsolete.

On the other hand, Graham also developed a fascination with art. He was inspired by a visit to the Carnegie Institute where he realized that paintings, unlike software, do not become obsolete and can last for hundreds of years. This realization led him to consider the possibility of becoming an artist himself. Despite having no prior experience, he started taking art classes at Harvard while still being in the PhD program.

Graham found himself working on multiple projects that were not related to his thesis. He was writing his book on Lisp, taking art classes, and still trying to complete his PhD. He was in a dilemma about how to reconcile his varied interests and find a way out of grad school.

A turning point came when his professor asked if he was ready to graduate. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham decided to write one in the remaining weeks before the deadline, reusing parts of his book ""On Lisp"" where he could. This decision reflects his attempt to reconcile his interests by integrating his work on Lisp into his academic obligations.",,0.6840747779998922,0.99999999995,1.0,1

He mentions that he started working on Lisp again in March 2015.

As for why he got back into Lisp, the author notes that it was one of the things he did after stopping work at YC. He seems to have approached learning and problem-solving in a way that allows him to explore different interests and topics, as evident from his transition from painting to writing essays again after stopping work on YC.

The author's approach appears to be driven by curiosity and a desire to improve or master something new. When he started working on Lisp again, it was after a period of rusty-ness, but he got better at it through focused effort. His willingness to learn and experiment is reflected in his statement that attention is a zero-sum game, implying that he prioritizes the projects that are most engaging and meaningful to him.","The author decided to write a book on Lisp hacking primarily because he found Lisp interesting in its own right, separate from its association with AI. He also believed that writing a book about something is a good way to learn it. This reflects his approach to learning and problem-solving as being hands-on and experiential. He's not afraid to dive into a subject he's not fully versed in, using the process of writing and explaining to deepen his understanding.

This implies that the process of painting a person requires a more interactive and potentially uncomfortable experience for the subject. In contrast, painting a still life does not require the presence or cooperation of the subject, allowing for a more relaxed and controlled environment.

The author also implies that painting still lives can provide a unique benefit in terms of visual perception, as it allows for a more focused attention on the subject matter without the distractions and variables introduced by human subjects.","In the essay, the author explains that painting a still life is different from painting a person because the subject of a still life doesn't move, unlike a person who can't sit still for more than about 15 minutes. When painting people, the traditional method is to know how to paint a generic person, which is then modified to match the specific person being painted. In contrast, a still life can be copied pixel by pixel from what the artist is seeing.

The author suggests that painting still lives allows for a deeper understanding of visual perception. In everyday life, much of what we see is processed by low-level brain functions that provide a general understanding of what we're seeing, without detailing every aspect. However, when painting a still life, the artist must look more closely and notice details that are usually overlooked. The author notes that this process of careful observation can lead to new discoveries even after days of painting something that people usually take for granted. Therefore, painting still lives can enhance visual perception by encouraging a more detailed and conscious observation of the world.",,0.5697348674650993,0.49999999995,0.6666666666666666,1

 'After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\n\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn\'t that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don\'t I become rich? Then I\'ll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I\'d been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I\'d seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.\n\nIf I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can\'t honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn\'t want to be online, and still don\'t, not the fancy ones. That\'s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.\n\nThen some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we\'d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an ""internet storefront"" was something we already knew how to build.\n\nSo in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we\'d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores â\x80\x94 in Lisp, of course.\n\nWe were working out of Robert\'s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we\'d never have to write anything to run on users\' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we\'d serve them from. Users wouldn\'t need anything more than a browser.\n\nThis kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn\'t clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn\'t need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.\n\nWe started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle\'s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator\'s. We knew founders needed something like this, because we\'d needed it ourselves.']","The author mentions that while working at Interleaf, he saw a group called Release Engineering that seemed to be as big as the team that actually wrote the software. This suggests that Interleaf had implemented a unique feature - a separate department responsible for managing and maintaining software releases, which was likely a significant innovation in the industry.

As for the author's role and self-assessment at Interleaf, he doesn't provide any details about his experience or performance there. The passage only mentions Interleaf as a context to contrast with the author's later experiences and ideas, particularly the concept of web apps and the formation of Viaweb.","Interleaf, the company where the author worked, had added a unique feature to their software. Inspired by Emacs, they incorporated a scripting language into their software, which was even made as a dialect of Lisp. This bold move was significant as it allowed for more complex and flexible operations within the software.

The author's role in the company was to write things in this scripting language, essentially functioning as a Lisp hacker. However, the author self-assesses his performance as poor. He admits to being a bad employee, stating that he didn't understand most of the software because their Lisp was just a thin layer on top of a large amount of C code, a language he didn't know and didn't want to learn. Additionally, he confesses to being terribly irresponsible, particularly in relation to the traditional working hours that were expected at the time.",0.2222222222222222,0.583022433628284,0.99999999995,0.6,1
10,"In the essay, the author discusses his experiences working at Interleaf. What was the author's role at Interleaf and how did his work habits differ from the traditional expectations of a programming job?","['But when the software is an online store builder and you\'re hosting the stores, if you don\'t have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We\'d had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles.

How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren\'t they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I\'m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don\'t already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\n\n[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\n\n[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs\' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\n\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\n\nHere\'s an interesting point, though: you can\'t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\n\n[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn\'t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\n\nI picked orange as our color partly because it\'s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\n\n[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.\n\n[15] I\'ve never liked the term ""deal flow,"" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it\'s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.\n\n[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.\n\n[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum, you\'re assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you\'re present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it\'s correct.

 ""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools.

 ""It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.""]","The author does not explicitly discuss their initial perception of the World Wide Web or its potential impact on the internet.

He believed that the web would be a ""big deal"" and could have a similar impact on the internet as graphical user interfaces had on the popularity of microcomputers.

15,"Describe the pivotal moment in the essay when the author realized the potential of running software on the server and allowing users to control it through their browsers. How did this realization impact the development of their company, Viaweb?","['After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\n\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn\'t that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don\'t I become rich? Then I\'ll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I\'d been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I\'d seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.\n\nIf I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can\'t honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn\'t want to be online, and still don\'t, not the fancy ones. That\'s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.\n\nThen some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we\'d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an ""internet storefront"" was something we already knew how to build.\n\nSo in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we\'d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores â\x80\x94 in Lisp, of course.\n\nWe were working out of Robert\'s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we\'d never have to write anything to run on users\' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we\'d serve them from. Users wouldn\'t need anything more than a browser.\n\nThis kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn\'t clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn\'t need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.\n\nWe started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle\'s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator\'s. We knew founders needed something like this, because we\'d needed it ourselves.'

 'But when the software is an online store builder and you\'re hosting the stores, if you don\'t have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We\'d had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn\'t know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn\'t an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants\' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren\'t they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I\'m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don\'t already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\n\n[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\n\n[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs\' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\n\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\n\nHere\'s an interesting point, though: you can\'t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\n\n[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn\'t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\n\nI picked orange as our color partly because it\'s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\n\n[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.\n\n[15] I\'ve never liked the term ""deal flow,"" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it\'s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.\n\n[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.\n\n[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum.

This is evident from the text where it mentions that some art galleries let them make sites for them for free, but none paid them.

The reason behind this strategy was the author's personal financial situation. He had recently become wealthy after selling his company, and as a result, he didn't need to worry about making money from their ecommerce software. This allowed him to focus on building a sustainable business model that prioritized growth over immediate profits.

This pricing strategy also made it difficult for competitors to compete with the author's company. Since their software was free, customers were more likely to choose them over competitors who required payment for similar services. The author's wealth also gave him the luxury of being able to invest in the development of his ecommerce software, which further solidified his position in the market.

In summary, the author's pricing strategy was attractive because it offered a unique value proposition to customers, and his personal financial situation allowed him to focus on building a sustainable business model that prioritized growth over immediate profits.","The author and his team priced their ecommerce software at $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was attractive to customers as it was affordable and provided value for money. It posed a problem for competitors because it was challenging for them to match or beat these prices while maintaining profitability. The author's personal financial situation influenced this pricing strategy because they were poor at the time. This caused them to perceive $300 a month as a lot of money, leading them to price their product lower than they might have if they had a better understanding of what businesses typically paid for such services. This lack of knowledge inadvertently led to a competitive pricing strategy.",,0.7374000676484868,0.0,0.75,1

This is evident when the author states, ""What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online."" Despite this initial mistake, the author's lack of business knowledge allowed him and Robert to approach the problem from a fresh perspective.

Another example of how the author's lack of business knowledge contributed to Viaweb's success is when he and Robert decided to write software that would allow users to control the store builder through their browsers. The text states, ""To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser."" This decision was likely driven by the author's lack of understanding of traditional business models, which allowed him and Robert to focus on creating something innovative.

Additionally, the author's lack of business knowledge may have also led him to avoid getting caught up in unnecessary complexities, such as trying to create software that would run on users' computers. Instead, he and Robert focused on building a web-based application, which proved to be successful.

Overall, the author's lack of business knowledge played a crucial role in Viaweb's success by allowing him and Robert to approach problems from a fresh perspective, focus on solving real-world issues, and avoid getting bogged down in unnecessary complexities.","The author's lack of business knowledge inadvertently contributed to the success of Viaweb in several ways. First, the author and his team set the price of their service low, charging $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This was not a strategic decision based on market research or business acumen, but rather because they were poor and $300 seemed like a lot of money to them. This low price turned out to be a big attraction for customers and a competitive advantage over other businesses.

Second, the author's lack of understanding about scaling led them to do things that didn't scale, such as building stores for their users. While this seemed humiliating and counterintuitive at the time, it turned out to be beneficial as it helped them understand retail and how their software was used, and it also helped them acquire users.

Lastly, the author's lack of business knowledge led them to focus on the absolute number of users rather than the growth rate. While this was a mistake in the author's eyes, it turned out that their growth rate was fine and they were growing 7x a year, which is a good sign for a startup.",,0.7401447667604603,0.49999999995,0.5,1

He highlights how the early recognition of the World Wide Web's potential led him to pivot from building art gallery websites to focusing on creating online stores, which ultimately became Viaweb. The emphasis on growth rate is seen in his desire to capitalize on the ""next train leaving the station"" and his willingness to adapt and iterate quickly.

This perspective influenced his decisions by encouraging a focus on rapid prototyping and experimentation. When he and Robert Morris initially struggled to get art galleries interested in their website-building service, they didn't give up. Instead, they leveraged their understanding of the web's potential to pivot towards building online stores, which proved more successful.

The eventual outcome for Viaweb was a thriving company that achieved significant growth. The author's focus on growth rate and willingness to adapt allowed them to capitalize on the emerging trends in the early days of the World Wide Web, ultimately leading to their success.","The author believes that the growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. He learned that the absolute number of users is important for immediate revenue, but in the long term, a high growth rate will ensure the absolute number increases. He reflects that if he had understood this earlier, he would have advised himself not to stress and not to hire too many people, as the company was growing seven times a year and was on the path to profitability.

However, he did hire more people, influenced by investor expectations and the norms of startups during the Internet Bubble. This decision delayed the company's break-even point and left them dependent on investors. The author regrets this, describing the result as a mess. Despite the company being profitable and growing rapidly, the author felt the near-death experiences every few months due to financial stress.

Eventually, Yahoo bought Viaweb, which the author describes as a huge relief and a transition from rags to riches. The author's perspective on the importance of growth rate, combined with his lack of understanding of how to value a business and manage growth, led to a stressful journey but ultimately a successful sale of the company.",,0.59686191657515,0.49999999995,0.75,1

 'But when the software is an online store builder and you\'re hosting the stores, if you don\'t have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We\'d had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn\'t know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn\'t an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants\' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren\'t they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I\'m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don\'t already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\n\n[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\n\n[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs\' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\n\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\n\nHere\'s an interesting point, though: you can\'t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\n\n[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn\'t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\n\nI picked orange as our color partly because it\'s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\n\n[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.\n\n[15] I\'ve never liked the term ""deal flow,"" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it\'s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.\n\n[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.\n\n[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum.

The essay primarily discusses topics such as Y Combinator, startup culture, language and programming, and the challenges of writing essays.","In the essay, the author describes a significant shift in his lifestyle after selling his company to Yahoo. Initially, he lived a grad student lifestyle, which didn't change much even after starting his company. However, after the sale to Yahoo, he experienced a sudden transition from rags to riches. He bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI, which he considered a luxury, and moved to California.

However, the following year was the least productive of his life. He was worn out from the stress of running Viaweb and struggled to adapt to Yahoo's work culture. Despite the wealth he had acquired, he felt unfulfilled and decided to leave Yahoo in the summer of 1999 to pursue his passion for painting.

Upon leaving Yahoo, he immediately started painting. However, he found that he lacked energy and ambition. He attributed part of this to his isolation in California, having bought a house in the Santa Cruz Mountains, far from any social connections. In desperation, he returned to New York, where he still had his old apartment.

Back in New York, he resumed his old life, but now he was rich. This wealth opened up new opportunities for him. He no longer had to walk everywhere; he could hail a taxi. He could afford to eat at charming little restaurants. His painting started to improve, and he began experimenting with new techniques.

However, despite the financial freedom, the author seemed to struggle with finding fulfillment and maintaining his ambition to paint.

 ""It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine.

The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question.

However, this attempt at creative adaptation was short-lived, as the author soon lost steam and stopped painting altogether.","The author's new approach to still life painting involved creating an initial painting in the traditional manner, then photographing it and printing the image, enlarged, onto a canvas. This printed image served as the underpainting for a second still life, which was painted from the same objects as the first, provided they hadn't decayed. This innovative technique reflects the author's ability to adapt creatively to his new circumstances. Being wealthy, he could afford the resources to experiment with new methods. Furthermore, his return to New York, a city known for its vibrant art scene, might have inspired him to push the boundaries of his craft.",,0.6284789428245807,,0.75,1

This shows his belief in the continuous improvement and evolution of open source projects, and his willingness to contribute to this process.

This is because people post highly imaginative misinterpretations on forums, which require responses to maintain a reputation of not tacitly admitting correctness.","In the essay, Paul Graham describes a significant shift in publishing essays from the print era to the digital era. During the print era, the channel for publishing essays was very narrow, with only a few officially anointed thinkers and specialists in their fields allowed to publish. The digital era, however, opened up the possibility for anyone to publish anything, a concept that Graham admits took him several years to fully comprehend.

Graham views this shift as a revolutionary change that allows for a whole new generation of essays. He acknowledges that it was surprising to realize that if he wrote something and put it on the web, anyone could read it. This realization led him to understand that there were so many essays that had never been written because there had been no way to publish them in the print era. Now, these essays could be written and published online.

Despite recognizing that online essays would be viewed as a marginal medium at first, Graham found this encouraging rather than discouraging. He saw the lack of prestige in online essays as a sign of something real to be discovered and a test of the right kind of motives. He warns against the danger of impure motives, such as the desire to impress people, and suggests that working on things that aren't prestigious can help avoid the most common type of wrong path.

In summary, Paul Graham views the shift from print to digital publishing as a liberating change that opens up new possibilities for essay writing. He sees it as an opportunity for new voices to be heard and new ideas to be shared, even if they initially lack prestige.",0.6,0.7031376483782156,,1.0,1

Instead, it details his experiences as a co-founder of Y Combinator (YC) and his eventual departure from the company.

Key events that influenced Paul Graham's decision to leave YC include:

1. His mother's stroke in 2012, which led him to re-evaluate his priorities.
2. The realization that he was ready to hand over control of YC to someone else.
3. Sam Altman's willingness to take over as president of YC, leading Paul Graham to gradually transfer responsibilities.

Important individuals involved in this process include:

1. Jessica Livingston: a co-founder of YC and Paul Graham's partner. She initially declined the offer to become president of YC but remained an active member.
2. Sam Altman: who eventually agreed to take over as president of YC, allowing Paul Graham to focus on other pursuits.

Paul Graham's decision to leave YC was not directly related to starting an investment firm. Instead, it was a result of his personal and professional growth, as well as the need for him to pass the torch to someone else.","In Paul Graham's essay, several key events and individuals influenced his decision to start an investment firm. 

One of the key individuals was Jessica Livingston, a woman he met at a party at his house. Jessica worked in marketing at a Boston investment bank and was compiling a book of interviews with startup founders. When she had to look for a new job due to financial problems at her bank, Paul began sharing his ideas about what needed to change in venture capital. Jessica's experience and insights from the startup world and her job search played a significant role in shaping their decision to start an investment firm.

Another key event was a talk Paul gave at the Harvard Computer Society on how to start a startup. During this talk, he shared his belief that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders. This talk made him realize that he should stop procrastinating about angel investing, a thought he had been entertaining since Yahoo bought his company.

Paul also mentions his friends Robert and Trevor, with whom he had been scheming about potential projects. Their shared history and desire to collaborate again influenced his decision to start an investment firm, with the idea that they could all work together on this new venture.

Finally, the frustration with the slow decision-making process of traditional venture capitalists (VCs) was a significant factor. This led to the decision to start their own investment firm, where they could implement their ideas and strategies. The lack of established angel investors to learn from in Boston in 2005 also played a role, as it forced them to make their own choices, some of which turned out to be novel.",0.75,0.5327948307926658,0.99999999995,1.0,1

However, it does provide some insights into the early days of Y Combinator and how its founders, including Paul Graham, approached startup investments.

One key aspect that emerges from the text is that Y Combinator's founders recognized the value of providing more than just financial support to their portfolio companies. For example, they gave away 10% equity in Viaweb (the precursor company) to Julian, Idelle's husband, in exchange for his help with seed funding, legal work, and business advice. This approach emphasizes the importance of personal connections and hands-on involvement in the startup ecosystem.

In contrast, traditional VC firms and angel investors often focus primarily on financial returns, investing in startups that have already demonstrated significant traction or potential for high growth. Y Combinator's approach, as described by Paul Graham, seems to prioritize building relationships with founders and providing support beyond just funding.

While not explicitly stated, this more personalized and involved approach might be seen as a key difference between Y Combinator and traditional VC firms and angel investors.","Y Combinator, as described in Paul Graham's essay, took a unique approach towards investing in startups. Unlike traditional VC firms and angel investors, Y Combinator was not organized as a fund and was funded with their own money. This was different from VC firms which were organized companies making large investments, and angels who were individuals making smaller investments on the side. Y Combinator's plan was to make seed investments and also provide support to startups in ways that traditional investors didn't, such as helping them get set up as a company.

Another distinctive feature of Y Combinator was its batch model. They would fund a group of startups all at once, twice a year, and then spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. This was discovered by accident due to their lack of experience as investors. They saw it as a way to gain experience by funding a bunch of startups at once, which was not a common practice among traditional investors.

An example of this approach in action was the Summer Founders Program, where they invited undergrads to start startups instead of taking up temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. This program resulted in a surprising number of applications, including from people who had already graduated or were about to. From these, they selected 8 groups to fund, including future successful companies like Reddit and Twitch. This shows how Y Combinator's unique approach allowed them to discover and invest in promising startups at an early stage.",0.7777777777777778,0.6340018870157332,0.99999999995,0.875,1

 ""It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.""]","The passage does not discuss the inception and initial implementation of the Summer Founders Program, nor does it mention the first batch or its participants. The text only touches on the topic of Y Combinator (YC), which was founded by Paul Graham, along with others. However, it does not provide details about a specific program within YC, such as the Summer Founders Program.

The passage mainly focuses on Paul Graham's personal experiences and thoughts, including his decision to leave YC, his mother's health issues, and his own pursuits in painting and writing essays. It also touches on Lisp, a programming language, and its history. There is no mention of the Summer Founders Program or its initial implementation.","In Paul Graham's essay, the inception of the Summer Founders Program (SFP) came about as a way for Graham and his partners to gain experience as investors. They decided to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and spend three months focusing intensively on helping them. The idea was to organize a summer program where undergraduates would start startups instead of getting temporary jobs at tech companies. The building Graham owned in Cambridge was used as headquarters, and weekly dinners and talks by startup experts were organized.

The SFP was announced on Graham's site, inviting undergraduates to apply. Surprisingly, they received 225 applications, many from people who had already graduated or were about to graduate. They invited about 20 of these groups for in-person interviews and selected 8 to fund.

The first batch of the SFP included notable participants who made significant contributions to the tech industry. This included the founders of Reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear who later founded Twitch, Aaron Swartz who helped write the RSS spec and became a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman who later became the second president of Y Combinator. Graham notes that the success of the first batch was not entirely due to luck, implying their selection and support process was effective.",,0.0,0.49999999995,0.5,0
30,"In the Summer Founders Program mentioned in the text, what were the terms of the deal for startups and how was it determined to be fair?","['But when the software is an online store builder and you\'re hosting the stores, if you don\'t have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We\'d had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn\'t know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn\'t an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants\' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren\'t they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I\'m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don\'t already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\n\n[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\n\n[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs\' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\n\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\n\nHere\'s an interesting point, though: you can\'t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\n\n[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn\'t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\n\nI picked orange as our color partly because it\'s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\n\n[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.\n\n[15] I\'ve never liked the term ""deal flow,"" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it\'s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.\n\n[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.\n\n[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum, you\'re assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you\'re present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it\'s correct. But that in turn encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses that now is their chance.\n\n[18] The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica anymore.'

 'We\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\'d all have dinner there once a week â\x80\x94 on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays â\x80\x94 and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.\n\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the ""YC GDP,"" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\'t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\'s intellectual curiosity.\n\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I\'d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\'s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe.']","Hacker News played a significant role in the context of Y Combinator. It served as a source of stress for the author, likely due to the need to respond to misinterpretations of his essays posted on the platform. This added an extra layer of responsibility and time commitment, making it a burden that impacted his work on YC. Despite being stressful, HN also contributed positively by providing a way to reach ""future startup founders"" and engage their intellectual curiosity. Its significance lay in its ability to connect with this target audience and become a valuable resource for YC, as well as its potential to drive deal flow and foster connections within the startup community.","Hacker News (HN) was initially created as a news aggregator for startup founders, but its focus shifted to cater to future startup founders, engaging their intellectual curiosity. It played a significant role in Y Combinator (YC) as it was beneficial for the organization. However, it was also a significant source of stress for the author. The author mentions that if his only task was to select and help founders, his life would have been much easier, implying that managing HN was a challenging task. He likens his situation to running a marathon with an ill-fitting shoe, causing more pain than the marathon itself. He states that when dealing with urgent problems during YC, there was a 60% chance it was related to HN, and a 40% chance it was related to everything else combined. Despite the stress, the author also wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc, the same language used to create HN. This indicates that HN was a significant part of the author's work in YC.",0.9090909090909091,0.8419365812226971,,1.0,1

However, it can be inferred that Jessica Livingston was a key figure at Y Combinator, as the author mentions ""leaving YC wasn't working with Jessica anymore"" and describes their relationship as being almost inseparable due to having worked together on YC for most of their time knowing each other.

There is no mention of anyone being approached or assuming the role of president.","The transition of leadership at Y Combinator was described as a thoughtful and gradual process. Initially, Jessica was asked if she wanted to be president, but she declined the offer. The team then decided to approach Sam Altman for the role. The decision to recruit Sam was part of a larger plan to ensure the longevity of Y Combinator. The founders believed that for YC to last a long time, it couldn't be controlled by the founders, hence the need for a change in leadership. Sam initially declined the offer as he wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. However, after persistent efforts, Sam finally agreed to take over as president in October 2013. The transition was gradual, with Sam taking over more responsibilities towards the end of 2013.

Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely.

I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game.

 'But when the software is an online store builder and you\'re hosting the stores, if you don\'t have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We\'d had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn\'t know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn\'t an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants\' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren\'t they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I\'m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don\'t already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\n\n[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\n\n[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs\' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\n\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\n\nHere\'s an interesting point, though: you can\'t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\n\n[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn\'t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\n\nI picked orange as our color partly because it\'s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\n\n[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.\n\n[15] I\'ve never liked the term ""deal flow,"" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it\'s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.\n\n[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.\n\n[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum, you\'re assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you\'re present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it\'s correct. But that in turn encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses that now is their chance.\n\n[18] The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica anymore.']","The author decided to step away from YC because his mother had a stroke, which destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home.

According to the author, Lisp's core is defined by writing an interpreter for itself, making it different from other programming languages. It was originally intended as a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine, rather than being designed as a traditional programming language.

The author notes that John McCarthy invented or discovered Lisp while trying to answer the question of what is the minimum set of predefined operators needed to write an interpreter for a language in itself. The language's origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match, making it distinct from others.

Furthermore, the author highlights how Lisp's evolution was influenced by its discovery as a programming language capable of being used on computers. This was thanks to Steve Russell, McCarthy's grad student, who translated the interpreter into IBM 704 machine language. As a result, Lisp started being used not only for theoretical purposes but also as a practical programming language.

The significance of Lisp as a programming language lies in its unique approach and history. Its origins as a formal model of computation and its subsequent development as a practical programming language make it distinct from other languages that were designed with a specific purpose or problem to solve.","In the essay, the author describes Lisp as a programming language that originated as a model of computation, which gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. This unique origin is what initially attracted the author to Lisp during his college years.

The author explains that Lisp was invented by John McCarthy in 1960, and its core is defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended to be a programming language in the ordinary sense, but rather a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. The minimum set of predefined operators needed to write an interpreter for a language in itself is what defines the Lisp that McCarthy invented.

However, McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could be used to program computers until his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point, Lisp began to be used as a programming language in the ordinary sense.

The author notes that McCarthy's original Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions and was missing many features that are desirable in a programming language. These features had to be added later, but they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach because it wouldn't have been feasible at the time due to the limitations of computers.

The author concludes by suggesting that with the power of modern computers, it would now be possible to continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach to define a complete programming language. As long as every change made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, one could, in principle, end up with a complete language that retained the unique qualities of Lisp.",,0.6402082992670708,0.0,1.0,1

For instance, his mother's stroke and subsequent diagnosis with colon cancer led him to re-evaluate his priorities and eventually decide to leave Y Combinator (YC). This personal experience prompted him to hand over the reins to someone else and focus on his own well-being.

Moreover, Graham's introspection during this period allowed him to gain clarity on his next steps. He realized that he was not ready to completely stop working, but rather needed to find a new path that brought him fulfillment. This introspective process led him to explore painting as an outlet for creativity and eventually return to writing essays.

Graham's decision-making process is also characterized by self-awareness and a willingness to adapt. He acknowledges the complexity of his own thought processes, noting that ""attention is a zero-sum game"" and that choosing what to work on can have significant opportunity costs. This self-awareness allows him to make more informed decisions about how to allocate his time and energy.

In essence, Graham's experience demonstrates that personal experiences and introspection can be powerful catalysts for professional growth and decision-making. By acknowledging the interconnectedness of personal and professional life, one can better navigate the complexities of choosing what to work on and make decisions that align with their values and goals.","In Paul Graham's essay, he reflects on his own decision-making process, demonstrating how personal experiences and introspection can greatly influence professional choices. He begins by asking himself how he had chosen what to work on in the past, indicating that he is drawing on his personal experiences to guide his future decisions. This introspective process leads him to a long and messy answer, suggesting that his decision-making process is complex and influenced by various factors from his life experiences.

For example, he mentions that he wrote an essay for himself to answer the question of how he chooses what to work on. This indicates that he uses writing as a tool for introspection, allowing him to articulate and understand his thoughts and experiences better. This introspective process can lead to surprising insights, as it did for Graham when he found his answer to be longer and messier than expected.

Furthermore, he thought that his introspective journey might be interesting and encouraging to others with similarly messy lives. This suggests that he believes his personal experiences and the insights gained from introspection can be valuable not only for his own decision-making process but also for others in similar situations.

In the notes, Graham also shares various personal experiences, from his time living in Florence (note 3) to his experiences with software and online publishing (notes 9, 10, 11). These experiences likely influenced his professional decisions, demonstrating how personal experiences can shape our professional lives.

In conclusion, Graham's essay illustrates how personal experiences and introspection can influence decision-making in professional life. By reflecting on past experiences and using introspection to understand our thoughts and feelings, we can gain valuable insights that guide our professional choices.",,0.6212437454470842,,1.0,1

This note contributes to the overall theme or message of the essay by highlighting the rapidly changing nature of technology and how it can be challenging for even the most innovative companies to keep pace. The author likely drew parallels between Interleaf's struggles with Moore's Law and his own experiences as an entrepreneur, emphasizing the importance of adapting quickly to technological advancements.

The significance of this note lies in its illustration of the relentless pressure of technological progress, which is a recurring theme throughout the essay.

However, he does mention how certain phenomena can become disastrous when combined, and how assumptions can lead to misinterpretations.

One example is his experience with Hacker News (HN), where writing essays and running a forum created a unique edge case. The combination of these two activities led to tedious but bearable individual issues becoming disastrous when combined.

Another example is his discussion about leaving YC, which was like pulling up a deeply rooted tree. This suggests that even after the original constraints have disappeared, certain customs or habits can persist and influence practices.

It's possible to interpret this as Graham discussing how customs or established ways of doing things can continue to influence our actions, even when the original circumstances that led to those customs are no longer present. However, this is not a direct explanation of the concept with reference to examples, but rather an interpretation based on the provided context.","Yes, Paul Graham discusses the concept of customs and their lasting influence in the essay. He uses the example of venture capital (VC) practices and the publishing of essays to illustrate this point. 

In the case of VC practices, he explains that these customs were formed during a time when startups were expensive to start and rare. However, even though startups can now be cheap and common, the customs of VCs still reflect the constraints of the old world. 

Similarly, he talks about how the customs of publishing essays still reflect the constraints of the print era, despite the advent of online publishing. 

He further argues that independent-minded individuals, who are less influenced by these outdated customs, have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change. This is because these customs are more likely to be obsolete in such rapidly changing environments.",,0.0,,1.0,1

 ""It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months.

 ""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\n\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?""]","Paul Graham describes leaving YC as like pulling up a deeply rooted tree, implying that the experience was significant and had a profound impact on him personally.
