One of the biggest challenges I faced in those early days was getting used to debugging and troubleshooting code.

The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and he didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but he didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type.

However, one influence that led him to develop an interest in AI was working on a new version of Arc, which he started with Robert in 2006. This project involved compiling Arc into Scheme, and testing this new Arc required writing code in Scheme. This experience likely influenced his interest in programming and possibly AI.

The other specific influence is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but it can be inferred that his work on YC (Y Combinator) and his interactions with startup founders might have indirectly sparked an interest in AI through their discussions about technology and innovation.","The two specific influences that led the author to develop an interest in AI were a novel and a documentary. The novel was ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" by Heinlein, which featured an intelligent computer named Mike. The author was drawn into the world of the novel and felt it was only a matter of time before we'd have an intelligent computer like Mike. The documentary was a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU, a computer program that used natural language processing.

3,"The author mentions his shift of interest towards Lisp, a programming language. What reasons does he provide for this shift and how did he further his understanding of Lisp?","['All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn\'t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\n\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven\'t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don\'t know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we\'d have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\n\nThere weren\'t any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers\' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn\'t happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.\n\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief â\x80\x94 hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 â\x80\x94 that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.\n\nI had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn\'t make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose ""Artificial Intelligence."" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.\n\nI applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I\'d visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who\'d invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\n\nI don\'t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that\'s told ""the dog is sitting on the chair"" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.\n\nWhat these programs really showed was that there\'s a subset of natural language that\'s a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.\n\nSo I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It\'s scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there\'s nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn\'t published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.'

 'We\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\'d all have dinner there once a week â\x80\x94 on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays â\x80\x94 and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.\n\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the ""YC GDP,"" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\'t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\'s intellectual curiosity.\n\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I\'d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\'s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe.']","As a student in graduate school, the author's passion for computer science and art is reflected in his personal projects. One example is the development of Arc, a new programming language that he works on alongside Robert. The fact that they compile Arc into Scheme demonstrates a strong foundation in computer science.

However, it's worth noting that there isn't a clear indication of the author attempting to reconcile his interests in computer science and art through specific projects or examples during his time in grad school. The text primarily focuses on his experiences with YC and Hacker News, which are more related to entrepreneurship and online communities rather than artistic pursuits.

The author does mention using his building as headquarters for YC and hosting dinners where they bring in experts on startups to give talks. This could be seen as a way of merging art and science by creating an environment that fosters creativity and innovation, but it's not explicitly stated as an attempt to reconcile the two interests.

In summary, while the author's work with Arc shows an interest in computer science, there isn't a clear example of him attempting to merge this with his artistic side during grad school.","The author in the essay is Paul Graham, who was pursuing a PhD in computer science but also developed an interest in art. He found himself in a complex situation where he was simultaneously exploring different fields and trying to reconcile his interests.

In terms of computer science, Graham was particularly interested in Lisp, a programming language. He decided to write a book about Lisp hacking, titled ""On Lisp,"" as a way to deepen his understanding of the language. He was also intrigued by the idea of building things that would last, which he felt was a challenge in the field of systems work in computer science as any program written would eventually become obsolete.

On the other hand, Graham also developed a fascination with art. He was inspired by a visit to the Carnegie Institute where he realized that paintings, unlike software, do not become obsolete and can last for hundreds of years. This realization led him to consider the possibility of becoming an artist himself. Despite having no prior experience, he started taking art classes at Harvard while still being in the PhD program.

Graham found himself working on multiple projects that were not related to his thesis. He was writing his book on Lisp, taking art classes, and still trying to complete his PhD. He was in a dilemma about how to reconcile his varied interests and find a way out of grad school.

A turning point came when his professor asked if he was ready to graduate. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham decided to write one in the remaining weeks before the deadline, reusing parts of his book ""On Lisp"" where he could. This decision reflects his attempt to reconcile his interests by integrating his work on Lisp into his academic obligations.",0.5833333333333334,0.0,0.99999999995,0.7,0
5,The author discusses his decision to write a book on Lisp hacking despite his limited knowledge about it. What reasons does he give for this decision and how does this reflect his approach to learning and problem-solving?,"[""It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.""
 ""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished.

I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be.

 'What I Worked On\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called ""data processing."" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines â\x80\x94 CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader â\x80\x94 sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\n\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\n\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\'m not surprised I can\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\'s expression made clear.\n\nWith microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]\n\nThe first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.\n\nComputers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he\'d write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.\n\nThough I liked programming, I didn\'t plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn\'t much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn\'t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\n\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven\'t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don\'t know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world.']","The author decided to switch from studying philosophy to studying AI in college after finding philosophy courses boring. He planned to execute this change by enrolling in new courses related to AI, presumably starting immediately or at the next available opportunity.","The author decided to attempt writing his dissertation in the 5 weeks that remained before the deadline, despite not having a single word written yet.

 ""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\n\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?""]","Painting a still life involves capturing the static and often mundane aspects of everyday objects, whereas painting a person can be more complex as it requires capturing their emotions, expressions, and movements. The author suggests that painting people can produce pained expressions in the sitters, implying that it's a more taxing and potentially uncomfortable process.

In contrast, still life painting allows for a more relaxed and controlled environment, where objects remain stationary and unchanged. This difference in approach may allow for a greater focus on visual details, textures, and lighting effects, making still life painting a valuable exercise in terms of visual perception.","In the essay, the author explains that painting a still life is different from painting a person because the subject of a still life doesn't move, unlike a person who can't sit still for more than about 15 minutes. When painting people, the traditional method is to know how to paint a generic person, which is then modified to match the specific person being painted. In contrast, a still life can be copied pixel by pixel from what the artist is seeing.

The author suggests that painting still lives allows for a deeper understanding of visual perception. In everyday life, much of what we see is processed by low-level brain functions that provide a general understanding of what we're seeing, without detailing every aspect. However, when painting a still life, the artist must look more closely and notice details that are usually overlooked. The author notes that this process of careful observation can lead to new discoveries even after days of painting something that people usually take for granted. Therefore, painting still lives can enhance visual perception by encouraging a more detailed and conscious observation of the world.",,0.5857152616778522,0.0,0.8571428571428571,1

 'We\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\'d all have dinner there once a week â\x80\x94 on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays â\x80\x94 and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.\n\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the ""YC GDP,"" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\'t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\'s intellectual curiosity.\n\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I\'d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\'s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe.']","The author's description of Interleaf is not present in the given context information.

However, based on the text, it can be inferred that YC (Y Combinator) had a unique feature where startups were funded in batches. This allowed for a sense of community among founders and also helped them become each other's customers. The author mentions that he was part of this system and notes its advantages.

The author does not mention Interleaf or any work experience at such a company.","Interleaf, the company where the author worked, had added a unique feature to their software. Inspired by Emacs, they incorporated a scripting language into their software, which was even made as a dialect of Lisp. This bold move was significant as it allowed for more complex and flexible operations within the software.

The author's role in the company was to write things in this scripting language, essentially functioning as a Lisp hacker. However, the author self-assesses his performance as poor. He admits to being a bad employee, stating that he didn't understand most of the software because their Lisp was just a thin layer on top of a large amount of C code, a language he didn't know and didn't want to learn. Additionally, he confesses to being terribly irresponsible, particularly in relation to the traditional working hours that were expected at the time.",0.6,0.0,,1.0,0
10,"In the essay, the author discusses his experiences working at Interleaf. What was the author's role at Interleaf and how did his work habits differ from the traditional expectations of a programming job?","['The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn\'t require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn\'t require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they\'d seen in American art magazines.\n\nOur model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She\'d copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he\'d take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]\n\nWhile I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can\'t move. People can\'t sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don\'t sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you\'re painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you\'re seeing. You don\'t want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it\'s been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it\'s the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. [4]\n\nI liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren\'t consciously aware of much we\'re seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain ""that\'s a water droplet"" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or ""that\'s a bush"" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there\'s a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.\n\nThis is not the only way to paint. I\'m not 100% sure it\'s even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.\n\nOur teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn\'t teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.\n\nI wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]\n\nInterleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they\'d added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I\'ve had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee.'

This was the closest thing I\'ve had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn\'t know C and didn\'t want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.\n\nThe good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was just sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to save enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.\n\nI learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I learned that it\'s better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it\'s depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there\'s not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.\n\nBut the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it\'s good to be the ""entry level"" option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you\'re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.\n\nWhen I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.\n\nIn the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.\n\nA signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a ""schtick"": something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else\'s. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it\'s by Roy Lichtenstein.'

This is evident in the early days of Hacker News, which was meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders. The name ""Startup News"" suggests that the author believed the web would be used mainly by entrepreneurs and start-up enthusiasts.

However, as the author continued to explore and experiment with online communities, their perception shifted towards seeing the web as a platform where people could engage with diverse topics and intellectual interests. The renaming of Hacker News to simply ""Hacker News"" and broadening its topic scope suggests that the author realized the potential for the web to serve as a hub for intellectual curiosity and discussion on various subjects.

This shift in perception is also reflected in the author's observation about space aliens knowing advanced mathematical concepts but potentially needing basic computer programming skills, which implies a recognition of the web's potential for serving broader purposes beyond startup-related content.","The author initially perceived the World Wide Web as a significant and transformative development.

 ""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\n\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?""]","The author's idea of starting a company to put art galleries online was not successful because it got crushed by Moore's Law.

15,"Describe the pivotal moment in the essay when the author realized the potential of running software on the server and allowing users to control it through their browsers. How did this realization impact the development of their company, Viaweb?","['After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\n\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn\'t that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don\'t I become rich? Then I\'ll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I\'d been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I\'d seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.\n\nIf I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can\'t honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn\'t want to be online, and still don\'t, not the fancy ones. That\'s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.\n\nThen some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we\'d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an ""internet storefront"" was something we already knew how to build.\n\nSo in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we\'d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores â\x80\x94 in Lisp, of course.\n\nWe were working out of Robert\'s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we\'d never have to write anything to run on users\' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we\'d serve them from. Users wouldn\'t need anything more than a browser.\n\nThis kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn\'t clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn\'t need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.\n\nWe started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle\'s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator\'s. We knew founders needed something like this, because we\'d needed it ourselves.'

However, it can be inferred that they built an online platform for startup founders.

In this context, I'll describe three main parts of the platform:

1. **Summer Founders Program**: This was a key component of their platform, which allowed undergraduate students to apply and receive funding for their startups. The author mentions that about 225 applications were received in just a matter of days.
2. **Deal Flow System**: Although not explicitly described as a separate software part, the deal flow system is mentioned as a way to manage startup investments. The author notes that they invested $6k per founder, in return for 6%, which was based on a combination of previous deals and MIT grad student funding structures.
3. **Arc Platform (later renamed Hacker News)**: This was a separate platform built by the author and his team, initially intended as a news aggregator for startup founders. It later evolved into a general interest forum called Hacker News.

The functions of these parts are not explicitly described, but based on the context, it can be inferred that they facilitated startup funding, deal flow management, and community engagement through online forums. The exact responsibilities of each part and their functions are not provided in the given text.","The three main parts of the software developed for the online store builder were the editor, the shopping cart, and the manager.

 'We\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\'d all have dinner there once a week â\x80\x94 on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays â\x80\x94 and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.\n\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the ""YC GDP,"" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention.

This was because they invested $6k per founder in return for 6% equity, which was a good deal for founders and made it hard for others to compete.

As for how the author's personal financial situation influenced this strategy, they mention that they had done a previous deal with Julian where they invested $10k for 10% equity. They then took a similar approach by offering $6k per founder in return for 6% equity, which was twice as good as their original deal with Julian. This suggests that the author's personal financial situation allowed them to take on more risk and offer more favorable terms to founders.","The author and his team priced their ecommerce software at $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was attractive to customers as it was affordable and provided value for money. It posed a problem for competitors because it was challenging for them to match or beat these prices while maintaining profitability. The author's personal financial situation influenced this pricing strategy because they were poor at the time. This caused them to perceive $300 a month as a lot of money, leading them to price their product lower than they might have if they had a better understanding of what businesses typically paid for such services.

 'After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\n\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn\'t that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don\'t I become rich? Then I\'ll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I\'d been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I\'d seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.\n\nIf I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can\'t honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn\'t want to be online, and still don\'t, not the fancy ones. That\'s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.\n\nThen some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we\'d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an ""internet storefront"" was something we already knew how to build.\n\nSo in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we\'d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores â\x80\x94 in Lisp, of course.\n\nWe were working out of Robert\'s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we\'d never have to write anything to run on users\' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we\'d serve them from. Users wouldn\'t need anything more than a browser.\n\nThis kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn\'t clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn\'t need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.

We knew founders needed something like this, because we\'d needed it ourselves.']","The author's lack of business knowledge led them to make mistakes and take unconventional approaches that ultimately contributed to the success of Viaweb. For instance, they initially tried to generate web sites for art galleries by writing software to resize images and set up an HTTP server. This was not a viable business model, but it showed their willingness to experiment and try new things.

Similarly, when they started working on online stores, they decided to write the software as Unix software, even though neither of them knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. This decision forced them to think creatively and find ways to work within the constraints of their own expertise, ultimately leading them to develop a web app that could be controlled through the browser.

The author's naivety about business also led them to underestimate the complexity of selling art galleries online, but this underestimation allowed them to pivot quickly when they realized it wasn't going to work. They then focused on building online stores, which became their core product.","The author's lack of business knowledge inadvertently contributed to the success of Viaweb in several ways. First, the author and his team set the price of their service low, charging $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This was not a strategic decision based on market research or business acumen, but rather because they were poor and $300 seemed like a lot of money to them. This low price turned out to be a big attraction for customers and a competitive advantage over other businesses.

Second, the author's lack of understanding about scaling led them to do things that didn't scale, such as building stores for their users. While this seemed humiliating and counterintuitive at the time, it turned out to be beneficial as it helped them understand retail and how their software was used, and it also helped them acquire users.

Lastly, the author's lack of business knowledge led them to focus on the absolute number of users rather than the growth rate. While this was a mistake in the author's eyes, it turned out that their growth rate was fine and they were growing 7x a year, which is a good sign for a startup.",0.6153846153846154,0.6368581298309532,,0.75,1

He realized that this rapid growth would not only allow Viaweb to reach a large number of users but also create a network effect, where each new user added value to the platform for all existing users.

The author's perspective on the importance of growth rate led him to focus on creating a scalable business model and making decisions that would facilitate rapid expansion. He chose to invest in building a robust infrastructure, hiring a team of developers, and creating a system that could handle a large number of users.

This perspective also influenced his decision to create a web-based platform, which allowed Viaweb to scale more easily than traditional software. The author recognized that if he had focused on building a traditional desktop application, it would have been much harder for the company to grow and reach a large market share.

The eventual outcome for Viaweb was that it grew rapidly, eventually becoming eBay, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world. The author's focus on growth rate and scalability played a significant role in this success, demonstrating the importance of considering these factors when starting or growing a startup business.","The author believes that the growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. He learned that the absolute number of users is important for immediate revenue, but in the long term, a high growth rate will ensure the absolute number increases. He reflects that if he had understood this earlier, he would have advised himself not to stress and not to hire too many people, as the company was growing seven times a year and was on the path to profitability.

However, he did hire more people, influenced by investor expectations and the norms of startups during the Internet Bubble. This decision delayed the company's break-even point and left them dependent on investors. The author regrets this, describing the result as a mess. Despite the company being profitable and growing rapidly, the author felt the near-death experiences every few months due to financial stress.

Eventually, Yahoo bought Viaweb, which the author describes as a huge relief and a transition from rags to riches. The author's perspective on the importance of growth rate, combined with his lack of understanding of how to value a business and manage growth, led to a stressful journey but ultimately a successful sale of the company.",,0.6914414380235256,0.99999999995,0.5,1

As someone's income increases, they may feel more confident in taking risks and pursuing their passions without worrying about the financial implications. This can lead to a sense of creative fulfillment, as the individual has the means to focus on the things that bring them joy.

However, it's also possible for an increased income to create a sense of complacency, where one becomes less motivated to push themselves beyond their current comfort zone. In this scenario, the desire to pursue new hobbies, such as painting, may not be driven by a sense of necessity but rather by a desire to relax and enjoy the fruits of one's labor.

Ultimately, the impact of financial security on ambition towards painting (or any creative pursuit) will depend on the individual's personality and priorities. Some people may find that their increased income gives them the freedom to pursue their artistic passions with renewed vigor, while others may feel less inclined to take risks or challenge themselves in new ways.","In the essay, the author describes a significant shift in his lifestyle after selling his company to Yahoo. Initially, he lived a grad student lifestyle, which didn't change much even after starting his company. However, after the sale to Yahoo, he experienced a sudden transition from rags to riches. He bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI, which he considered a luxury, and moved to California.

However, the following year was the least productive of his life. He was worn out from the stress of running Viaweb and struggled to adapt to Yahoo's work culture. Despite the wealth he had acquired, he felt unfulfilled and decided to leave Yahoo in the summer of 1999 to pursue his passion for painting.

Upon leaving Yahoo, he immediately started painting. However, he found that he lacked energy and ambition. He attributed part of this to his isolation in California, having bought a house in the Santa Cruz Mountains, far from any social connections. In desperation, he returned to New York, where he still had his old apartment.

Back in New York, he resumed his old life, but now he was rich. This wealth opened up new opportunities for him. He no longer had to walk everywhere; he could hail a taxi. He could afford to eat at charming little restaurants. His painting started to improve, and he began experimenting with new techniques.

However, despite the financial freedom, the author seemed to struggle with finding fulfillment and maintaining his ambition to paint. The transition from a grad student lifestyle to sudden wealth brought about new opportunities but also new challenges in his pursuit of his passion.",,0.6098135820807414,0.99999999995,0.42857142857142855,1

He used to paint her in all sorts of poses, but now she was gone, and he found himself struggling to create anything meaningful without her presence.

So, I started experimenting with a new technique - using charcoal on canvas instead of traditional brushes and paints. The rough texture of the charcoal seemed to evoke a sense of raw emotion that I wasn't able to capture with my usual methods.

As I worked on these new pieces, I began to feel like I was tapping into something deeper within myself. It was as if the absence of my model had freed me up to explore new possibilities and express myself in ways I never thought possible.

The resulting paintings were unlike anything I'd ever created before - they were bold, expressive, and full of life. They seemed to capture the essence of my emotions and experiences in a way that my previous work had not.

It was a truly liberating experience, and one that taught me the value of creative adaptation and experimentation. By pushing myself outside of my comfort zone and trying new things, I was able to tap into a source of inspiration and creativity that I never knew existed.","The author's new approach to still life painting involved creating an initial painting in the traditional manner, then photographing it and printing the image, enlarged, onto a canvas. This printed image served as the underpainting for a second still life, which was painted from the same objects as the first, provided they hadn't decayed. This innovative technique reflects the author's ability to adapt creatively to his new circumstances. Being wealthy, he could afford the resources to experiment with new methods.

23,"The author mentions a new dialect of Lisp that he worked on, called Arc. What are some reasons he gives for why Lisp hackers often dream of building a new Lisp?","[""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\n\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?""
 ""It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.""]","They want to escape the constraints and limitations of their current language and create something better, more elegant, and powerful, much like the original inventor John McCarthy had done when he discovered Lisp as a model of computation. They are driven by a desire to build something that can be used to create an interpreter for itself, with a minimum set of predefined operators that can capture the essence of computation in all its forms.","The author mentions that Lisp hackers often dream of building a new Lisp partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects.

The thought experiment with space aliens helped to clarify that there could be multiple paths out of McCarthy's Lisp without sacrificing discoverability. This led to the realization that it might be possible to create new languages that preserved the essence of McCarthy's Lisp, opening up possibilities for innovation and improvement in programming languages.

The work on Arc was a natural extension of this line of thinking. By creating a compiled version of Scheme, Paul Graham aimed to develop a faster and more efficient language, which ultimately led him to test it by building Hacker News. This project not only showcased the potential of Arc but also provided valuable insights into the dynamics of online communities and the importance of engaging intellectual curiosity.

However, the experience with Hacker News also taught Paul Graham about the challenges of managing a large-scale open-source project. The stress and demands that came with it forced him to reevaluate his priorities and consider the implications of taking on such a responsibility. This newfound perspective likely influenced his views on open-source projects, making him more aware of the potential pitfalls and complexities involved in creating and maintaining them.

In summary, Paul Graham's work on Arc was a significant step forward in understanding the concept of invented vs discovered and opened up possibilities for innovation in programming languages. The experience with Hacker News provided valuable insights into the dynamics of online communities and the importance of engaging intellectual curiosity, as well as the challenges and complexities involved in managing large-scale open-source projects.","In Paul Graham's essay, his work on the new dialect of Lisp, Arc, is significant as it represents his contribution to the open-source community. He had spent a considerable amount of time thinking about this new architecture and even attempted to write some of it. This experience proved to be very useful when he encountered startups working on parts of this new architecture after starting Y Combinator.

His work on Arc also reflects his perspective towards open source projects. He saw the potential of building a new Lisp, a dream shared by many Lisp hackers, due to its distinctive feature of having dialects and the idea of a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. This shows his belief in the continuous improvement and evolution of open source projects, and his willingness to contribute to this process.

Furthermore, his work on Arc and the subsequent feedback he received from the community may have influenced his perspective on the power of the internet as a platform for sharing ideas and knowledge. This is evident when he started publishing essays online and realized the potential of the web as a medium for publishing, which was not limited by the traditional constraints of print media.",,0.7265846060008351,0.99999999995,1.0,1

Paul Graham reflects on how, through YC's Summer Founders Program, he leveraged his writing as a way to attract ""deal flow,"" attracting many applications from individuals who had already graduated or were about to do so, including some notable startups like Reddit.

In contrast to the past where essays might have been more exclusive and limited in circulation, the digital era has made it possible for essays to reach a wider audience. This is evident in how Hacker News was transformed from being primarily focused on startup founders to covering topics that engage intellectual curiosity, reaching a broader scope of readers.

Paul Graham views this shift as significant, particularly in how it democratizes access to information and ideas. By leveraging his writing to scale startup funding through YC's model, he effectively harnessed the power of essays to reach a wider audience and facilitate connection among founders. This approach suggests that, for him, publishing essays has become not just about sharing personal thoughts but also about creating a platform for knowledge exchange and community building.

Furthermore, the shift implies a change in the role and potential impact of essays beyond their traditional confines as intellectual or literary works. In the digital era, essays can serve as catalysts for action, facilitating collaboration, and generating ideas that can influence future generations.","In the essay, Paul Graham describes a significant shift in publishing essays from the print era to the digital era. During the print era, the channel for publishing essays was very narrow, with only a few officially anointed thinkers and specialists in their fields allowed to publish. The digital era, however, opened up the possibility for anyone to publish anything, a concept that Graham admits took him several years to fully comprehend.

Graham views this shift as a revolutionary change that allows for a whole new generation of essays. He acknowledges that it was surprising to realize that if he wrote something and put it on the web, anyone could read it. This realization led him to understand that there were so many essays that had never been written because there had been no way to publish them in the print era. Now, these essays could be written and published online.

Despite recognizing that online essays would be viewed as a marginal medium at first, Graham found this encouraging rather than discouraging. He saw the lack of prestige in online essays as a sign of something real to be discovered and a test of the right kind of motives. He warns against the danger of impure motives, such as the desire to impress people, and suggests that working on things that aren't prestigious can help avoid the most common type of wrong path.

In summary, Paul Graham views the shift from print to digital publishing as a liberating change that opens up new possibilities for essay writing. He sees it as an opportunity for new voices to be heard and new ideas to be shared, even if they initially lack prestige.",0.4117647058823529,0.8139175205616697,0.99999999995,0.5,1

One crucial turning point was when Graham used his building in Cambridge as a headquarters for a program he called the Summer Founders Program. This initiative attracted 225 applications from talented young entrepreneurs, which surprised him given that most applicants were actually graduated or about to graduate. This experience highlighted the potential for a startup program and its ability to attract top talent.

The success of the Summer Founders Program can be attributed in part to Graham's deal with Julian, which involved investing $10k in exchange for 10% equity. He then adapted this model by investing $6k per founder (in the typical two-founder case) in return for 6%, which made it a more attractive option for startups.

The key individuals who influenced Graham's decision to start an investment firm include Robert, with whom he worked on a new version of Arc and also shared insights on startup funding. Robert's contributions were significant, as they helped shape the deal that would be used for startups.

Graham's experiences with Hacker News (HN) also played a role in shaping his views on investing in startups. The challenges associated with running HN taught him the importance of creating a supportive community and highlighting the value of alumni networks within startup ecosystems.

The combination of these events and interactions with key individuals ultimately led Graham to start an investment firm, which he called Y Combinator (YC). The early success of YC can be attributed in part to the Summer Founders Program, which demonstrated the potential for a batch-based model of investing in startups. This approach allowed YC to scale startup funding more conveniently and provided benefits to both the investors and the founders involved.","In Paul Graham's essay, several key events and individuals influenced his decision to start an investment firm. 

One of the key individuals was Jessica Livingston, a woman he met at a party at his house. Jessica worked in marketing at a Boston investment bank and was compiling a book of interviews with startup founders. When she had to look for a new job due to financial problems at her bank, Paul began sharing his ideas about what needed to change in venture capital. Jessica's experience and insights from the startup world and her job search played a significant role in shaping their decision to start an investment firm.

Another key event was a talk Paul gave at the Harvard Computer Society on how to start a startup. During this talk, he shared his belief that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders. This talk made him realize that he should stop procrastinating about angel investing, a thought he had been entertaining since Yahoo bought his company.

Paul also mentions his friends Robert and Trevor, with whom he had been scheming about potential projects. Their shared history and desire to collaborate again influenced his decision to start an investment firm, with the idea that they could all work together on this new venture.

Finally, the frustration with the slow decision-making process of traditional venture capitalists (VCs) was a significant factor. This led to the decision to start their own investment firm, where they could implement their ideas and strategies. The lack of established angel investors to learn from in Boston in 2005 also played a role, as it forced them to make their own choices, some of which turned out to be novel.",,0.5692584239617903,0.99999999995,0.8333333333333334,1

I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.\n\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the ""YC GDP,"" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job.

This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\'t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\'s intellectual curiosity.\n\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I\'d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\'s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe.']","The unique approach taken by Y Combinator (YC) towards investing in startups was based on a batch model, where they would fund multiple startups at once, rather than individual investments like traditional VC firms or angel investors.

According to the essay, this approach solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: isolation. By being part of a batch, founders not only had colleagues who understood their problems but could also share solutions and experiences.

This model was inspired by the Summer Founders Program (SFP) that YC created, where they invited undergrads to apply and funded about 8 groups out of 225 applications. The first batch included successful startups like Reddit, Twitch, and Stripe, which suggests that this approach can be effective in identifying and supporting promising ventures.

The essay highlights how the batch model allowed YC to scale startup funding more conveniently for themselves while being better for the startups. As YC grew, they noticed other advantages of scale, such as a tight community of alumni dedicated to helping one another, and startups becoming each other's customers.

In contrast to traditional VC firms or angel investors who typically invest in individual startups, YC's batch model created a sense of community among founders, making it easier for them to connect with peers who understood their challenges. This approach differentiated YC from other investment models and allowed them to provide more comprehensive support to the startups they funded.","Y Combinator, as described in Paul Graham's essay, took a unique approach towards investing in startups. Unlike traditional VC firms and angel investors, Y Combinator was not organized as a fund and was funded with their own money. This was different from VC firms which were organized companies making large investments, and angels who were individuals making smaller investments on the side. Y Combinator's plan was to make seed investments and also provide support to startups in ways that traditional investors didn't, such as helping them get set up as a company.

Another distinctive feature of Y Combinator was its batch model. They would fund a group of startups all at once, twice a year, and then spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. This was discovered by accident due to their lack of experience as investors. They saw it as a way to gain experience by funding a bunch of startups at once, which was not a common practice among traditional investors.

An example of this approach in action was the Summer Founders Program, where they invited undergrads to start startups instead of taking up temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. This program resulted in a surprising number of applications, including from people who had already graduated or were about to. From these, they selected 8 groups to fund, including future successful companies like Reddit and Twitch. This shows how Y Combinator's unique approach allowed them to discover and invest in promising startups at an early stage.",,0.622832683395309,0.99999999995,0.75,1

However, it was not until 2005 that they established Y Combinator, which is now known as the Summer Founders Program.

In the first batch of startups, one notable participant was Trevor Blackwell and his co-founder Robert Morris, who went on to found a startup called Lighthouse. Another notable participant was John Collison and Patrick Collison, brothers who founded a company that later became Stripe.","In Paul Graham's essay, the inception of the Summer Founders Program (SFP) came about as a way for Graham and his partners to gain experience as investors.

The building Graham owned in Cambridge was used as headquarters, and weekly dinners and talks by startup experts were organized.

The SFP was announced on Graham's site, inviting undergraduates to apply. Surprisingly, they received 225 applications, many from people who had already graduated or were about to graduate. They invited about 20 of these groups for in-person interviews and selected 8 to fund.

The first batch of the SFP included notable participants who made significant contributions to the tech industry.

 ""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools.

The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\n\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?""]","Paul's experience with managing a forum while writing essays led him to realize that having the ability to respond to every conversation, even if it involved misinterpretations of his work, was crucial.

How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren\'t they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I\'m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don\'t already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\n\n[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\n\n[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs\' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\n\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\n\nHere\'s an interesting point, though: you can\'t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\n\n[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn\'t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\n\nI picked orange as our color partly because it\'s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\n\n[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally.

This is not only false, but it\'s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.\n\n[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.\n\n[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum.

In terms of taking on a president role, there isn't any mention of someone specifically being approached or assuming that position.","The transition of leadership at Y Combinator was described as a thoughtful and gradual process. Initially, Jessica was asked if she wanted to be president, but she declined the offer. The team then decided to approach Sam Altman for the role. The decision to recruit Sam was part of a larger plan to ensure the longevity of Y Combinator. The founders believed that for YC to last a long time, it couldn't be controlled by the founders, hence the need for a change in leadership. Sam initially declined the offer as he wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. However, after persistent efforts, Sam finally agreed to take over as president in October 2013. The transition was gradual, with Sam taking over more responsibilities towards the end of 2013.

34,"In the context of the essay, why did the author decide to step away from YC and start painting? What led him to eventually stop painting and return to writing essays and working on Lisp?","['All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn\'t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\n\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven\'t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don\'t know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we\'d have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\n\nThere weren\'t any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers\' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn\'t happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.\n\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief â\x80\x94 hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 â\x80\x94 that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.\n\nI had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn\'t make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose ""Artificial Intelligence."" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.\n\nI applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I\'d visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who\'d invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\n\nI don\'t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that\'s told ""the dog is sitting on the chair"" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.\n\nWhat these programs really showed was that there\'s a subset of natural language that\'s a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.\n\nSo I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It\'s scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there\'s nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn\'t published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.'

Its origins as a model of computation gave it power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was originally intended to be a formal model of computation, not a programming language in the ordinary sense, but its ability to write an interpreter for itself made it suitable for programming computers as well. This unique characteristic makes Lisp distinct from other programming languages.","In the essay, the author describes Lisp as a programming language that originated as a model of computation, which gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. This unique origin is what initially attracted the author to Lisp during his college years.

The author explains that Lisp was invented by John McCarthy in 1960, and its core is defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended to be a programming language in the ordinary sense, but rather a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. The minimum set of predefined operators needed to write an interpreter for a language in itself is what defines the Lisp that McCarthy invented.

However, McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could be used to program computers until his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point, Lisp began to be used as a programming language in the ordinary sense.

The author notes that McCarthy's original Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions and was missing many features that are desirable in a programming language. These features had to be added later, but they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach because it wouldn't have been feasible at the time due to the limitations of computers.

The author concludes by suggesting that with the power of modern computers, it would now be possible to continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach to define a complete programming language. As long as every change made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, one could, in principle, end up with a complete language that retained the unique qualities of Lisp.",,0.7006255705062661,,1.0,1

 'We\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\'d all have dinner there once a week â\x80\x94 on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays â\x80\x94 and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.\n\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the ""YC GDP,"" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\'t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\'s intellectual curiosity.\n\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I\'d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\'s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe.']","As people delve into complex endeavors, they often underestimate the intricacies of their own thought processes. This was the case for Paul Graham, who found that his work on YC and other projects had evolved beyond his initial expectations.

Graham's experience illustrates how personal experiences and introspection can significantly influence decision-making in professional life. Initially, he intended to dedicate only a third of his attention to YC, but as it grew, so did his investment in the project.

This phenomenon highlights the importance of self-awareness and introspection in navigating complex decisions. Graham's realization that YC was taking up more than a third of his attention suggests that he had to reassess his priorities and adapt to the changing circumstances.

Furthermore, Graham's experience with Hacker News demonstrates how personal experiences can shape decision-making processes. He initially intended for HN to be a news aggregator for startup founders but later shifted its focus to engage the intellectual curiosity of future founders.

In this context, introspection allowed Graham to reflect on his own goals and values, leading him to make adjustments that better aligned with his vision for YC and HN. This example illustrates how personal experiences can influence decision-making by fostering a deeper understanding of one's priorities and values.

Ultimately, Graham's story serves as a reminder that decision-making is often more nuanced than expected. By embracing introspection and self-awareness, professionals can develop a more informed approach to making decisions, even when faced with complex and evolving circumstances.","In Paul Graham's essay, he reflects on his own decision-making process, demonstrating how personal experiences and introspection can greatly influence professional choices. He begins by asking himself how he had chosen what to work on in the past, indicating that he is drawing on his personal experiences to guide his future decisions. This introspective process leads him to a long and messy answer, suggesting that his decision-making process is complex and influenced by various factors from his life experiences.

For example, he mentions that he wrote an essay for himself to answer the question of how he chooses what to work on. This indicates that he uses writing as a tool for introspection, allowing him to articulate and understand his thoughts and experiences better. This introspective process can lead to surprising insights, as it did for Graham when he found his answer to be longer and messier than expected.

Furthermore, he thought that his introspective journey might be interesting and encouraging to others with similarly messy lives. This suggests that he believes his personal experiences and the insights gained from introspection can be valuable not only for his own decision-making process but also for others in similar situations.

In the notes, Graham also shares various personal experiences, from his time living in Florence (note 3) to his experiences with software and online publishing (notes 9, 10, 11). These experiences likely influenced his professional decisions, demonstrating how personal experiences can shape our professional lives.

In conclusion, Graham's essay illustrates how personal experiences and introspection can influence decision-making in professional life. By reflecting on past experiences and using introspection to understand our thoughts and feelings, we can gain valuable insights that guide our professional choices.",,0.6509504190045277,,1.0,1

This note highlights the impermanence and unpredictability of technological advancements. The author mentions how Interleaf, a company with talented individuals and innovative technology, eventually became obsolete due to the exponential growth in processor power. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the ""invented vs discovered"" concept discussed earlier in the essay, where even the most advanced technologies can become outdated and surpassed by new discoveries.

The significance of this note lies in its contribution to the overall theme of the essay: the importance of adaptability and learning from past experiences. The author's story about Interleaf serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating how even the best-laid plans can be upended by unforeseen circumstances. This note encourages readers to stay curious, remain open-minded, and continually update their knowledge and skills to stay relevant in an ever-changing world.

In this context, the note also subtly underscores the value of humility and acknowledging one's limitations. The author's account of Interleaf's demise serves as a reminder that even the most seemingly invincible ideas or technologies can fall victim to the march of progress. This nuance adds depth to the essay's overall message, encouraging readers to be more mindful of their own strengths and weaknesses in the face of an uncertain future.","Without the full context of the essay, it's difficult to determine the exact significance of each note.

Consider a situation where a complex system has evolved over time. Initially, certain limitations may have been imposed on its development, leading to specific patterns or practices emerging as workarounds. As the system matures and those original constraints fade away, it might seem reasonable to assume that these inherited traits would also disappear. However, the example of McCarthy's Lisp illustrates that this isn't always the case.

The essay points out that even if a sufficiently advanced alien civilization were to know about the Pythagorean theorem, there's no reason to suppose that they wouldn't also understand concepts like numbers and errors, which are fundamental to programming languages like Lisp. This suggests that the existence of a path in McCarthy's Lisp that preserves discoveredness is not just a historical relic but rather an inherent trait of the system.

In other words, just because the original constraints have disappeared doesn't mean that the inherited traits or customs from earlier systems will necessarily fade away as well. They can persist even when their initial justification no longer applies, influencing the practices and behaviors of subsequent systems in subtle yet profound ways.","Yes, Paul Graham discusses the concept of customs and their lasting influence in the essay. He uses the example of venture capital (VC) practices and the publishing of essays to illustrate this point. 

In the case of VC practices, he explains that these customs were formed during a time when startups were expensive to start and rare. However, even though startups can now be cheap and common, the customs of VCs still reflect the constraints of the old world. 

Similarly, he talks about how the customs of publishing essays still reflect the constraints of the print era, despite the advent of online publishing. 

He further argues that independent-minded individuals, who are less influenced by these outdated customs, have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change. This is because these customs are more likely to be obsolete in such rapidly changing environments.",,0.6675783996937662,,0.5,1

 ""It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.""]","He uses the analogy of a child who can write a beautiful poem, but when asked about it says that he didn't really invent the poem, he just found it by following certain rules. This illustrates the distinction between invented and discovered knowledge, where the former is created through conscious effort, while the latter is uncovered through understanding and applying underlying principles.","In the essay, Paul Graham uses the concept of an advanced alien civilization to illustrate the idea of invented versus discovered knowledge. He posits that any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean theorem, suggesting that this knowledge is universal and thus discovered, not invented. He also believes, though with less certainty, that these aliens would know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper. This implies that the Lisp language, like the Pythagorean theorem, is a discovered knowledge that transcends human invention. He further speculates that there might be no limit to the language that might be known to these aliens, suggesting the possibility of more discovered knowledge.",0.6,0.5449351477134303,,1.0,1

How does he describe this experience and what does it reveal about his personal and professional relationship with Jessica?,"['But when the software is an online store builder and you\'re hosting the stores, if you don\'t have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We\'d had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles.

But this wasn\'t an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants\' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren\'t they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I\'m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don\'t already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\n\n[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\n\n[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs\' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\n\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\n\nHere\'s an interesting point, though: you can\'t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\n\n[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn\'t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\n\nI picked orange as our color partly because it\'s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\n\n[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.\n\n[15] I\'ve never liked the term ""deal flow,"" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it\'s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.\n\n[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.\n\n[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum, you\'re assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you\'re present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it\'s correct. But that in turn encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses that now is their chance.\n\n[18] The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica anymore.'
