In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be ""selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations"".:â\x80\x8a227â\x80\x93228â\x80\x8aProgress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a549â\x80\x8a To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the ""many unsolved problems"", and in the face of better alternative theories (Psychology). For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8aTo Thagard, astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone\'s career, twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies, lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy\'s time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time.:â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a Rather, his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci: ""theory, community [and] historical context"".\nWhile verification and falsifiability focused on the theory, Kuhn\'s work focused on the historical context, but the astrological community should also be considered. Whether or not they::â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a\nare focused on comparing their approach to others.\nhave a consistent approach.\ntry to falsify their theory through experiment.In this approach, true falsification rather than modifying a theory to avoid the falsification only really occurs when an alternative theory is proposed.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Irrationality ===\nFor the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.:â\x80\x8a34â\x80\x8a\nWhat if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational. ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning.\nThis poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning, and vague claims. The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly ""the same place have a life pattern that is very similar"" is vague, but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of ""same place"" despite the planet\'s moving in the reference frame of the Solar System. Other comments by astrologers are based on severely erroneous interpretations of basic physics, such as the general belief by medieval astrologers that the geocentric Solar System corresponded to an atom. Further, James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic, an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology, but any differences are due to ""heredity and environment"", while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology.:â\x80\x8a32â\x80\x8a Further, to astrologers, if something appears in their favour, they may latch upon it as proof, while making no attempt to explore its implications, preferring to refer to the item in favour as definitive; possibilities that do not make astrology look favourable are ignored.:â\x80\x8a33â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Quinean dichotomy ===\nFrom the Quinean web of knowledge, there is a dichotomy where one must either reject astrology or accept astrology but reject all established scientific disciplines that are incompatible with astrology.:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a'
 '=== Lack of predictive power ===\nSome astrologers make claims that the position of all the planets must be taken into account, but astrologers were unable to predict the existence of Neptune based on mistakes in horoscopes. Instead Neptune was predicted using Newton\'s law of universal gravitation. The grafting on of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto into the astrology discourse was done on an ad hoc basis.On the demotion of Pluto to the status of dwarf planet, Philip Zarka of the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France wondered how astrologers should respond:\nShould astrologers remove it from the list of luminars [Sun, Moon and the 8 planets other than earth] and confess that it did not actually bring any improvement? If they decide to keep it, what about the growing list of other recently discovered similar bodies (Sedna, Quaoar. etc), some of which even have satellites (Xena, 2003EL61)?\n\n\n=== Lack of mechanism ===\nAstrology has been criticised for failing to provide a physical mechanism that links the movements of celestial bodies to their purported effects on human behaviour. In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","The query is asking about a topic unrelated to the provided context.

 '== Sociology ==\nIn 1953, sociologist Theodor W. Adorno conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project that examined mass culture in capitalist society.:â\x80\x8a326â\x80\x8a Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably led to statements that encouraged conformityâ\x80\x94and that astrologers who went against conformity with statements that discouraged performance at work etc. risked losing their jobs.:â\x80\x8a327â\x80\x8a Adorno concluded that astrology was a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where flattery and vague generalisations subtly led individuals to believe the author of the column addressed them directly. Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people, by Karl Marx, by commenting, ""Occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes."":â\x80\x8a329â\x80\x8aFalse balance is where a false, unaccepted or spurious viewpoint is included alongside a well reasoned one in media reports and TV appearances and as a result the false balance implies ""there were two equal sides to a story when clearly there were not"". During Wonders of the Solar System, a TV programme by the BBC, the physicist Brian Cox said: ""Despite the fact that astrology is a load of rubbish, Jupiter can in fact have a profound influence on our planet. And it\'s through a force... gravity."" This upset believers in astrology who complained that there was no astrologer to provide an alternative viewpoint. Following the complaints of astrology believers, Cox gave the following statement to the BBC: ""I apologise to the astrology community for not making myself clear. I should have said that this new age drivel is undermining the very fabric of our civilisation."" In the programme Stargazing Live, Cox further commented by saying: ""in the interests of balance on the BBC, yes astrology is nonsense."" In an editorial in the medical journal BMJ, editor Trevor Jackson cited this incident showing where false balance could occur.Studies and polling have shown that the belief in astrology is higher in Western countries than might otherwise be expected. In 2012, in polls 42% of Americans said they thought astrology was at least partially scientific.:â\x80\x8a7/25â\x80\x8a This belief decreased with education and education is highly correlated with levels of scientific knowledge.:â\x80\x8a345â\x80\x8aSome of the reported belief levels are due to a confusion of astrology with astronomy (the scientific study of celestial objects). The closeness of the two words varies depending on the language.:â\x80\x8a344,â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a A plain description of astrology as an ""occult influence of stars, planets etc. on human affairs"" had no impact on the general public\'s assessment of whether astrology is scientific or not in a 1992 eurobarometer poll. This may partially be due to the implicit association amongst the general public, of any wording ending in ""-ology"" with a legitimate field of knowledge.:â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a In Eurobarometers 224 and 225 performed in 2004, a split poll was used to isolate confusion over wording. In half of the polls, the word ""astrology"" was used, while in the other the word ""horoscope"" was used.:â\x80\x8a349â\x80\x8a Belief that astrology was at least partially scientific was 76%, but belief that horoscopes were at least partially scientific was 43%. In particular, belief that astrology was very scientific was 26% while that of horoscopes was 7%.:â\x80\x8a352â\x80\x8a This appeared to indicate that the high level of apparent polling support for astrology in the EU was indeed due to confusion over terminology.:â\x80\x8a362â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of topics characterized as pseudoscience\nReligion and science\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMerrifield, Michael.

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory.

If they decide to keep it, what about the growing list of other recently discovered similar bodies (Sedna, Quaoar. etc), some of which even have satellites (Xena, 2003EL61)?\n\n\n=== Lack of mechanism ===\nAstrology has been criticised for failing to provide a physical mechanism that links the movements of celestial bodies to their purported effects on human behaviour. In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","There is no mention or relevance to walking under a ladder in the provided context.

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.'

In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted.

 'Astrology consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe.

It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance.

 '== Introduction ==\nThe majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator\'s future.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8a Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so ""in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary"".

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.:â\x80\x8a17â\x80\x9318â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a']","There is no mention or reference to speaking of the Devil in the provided context.

 '== Introduction ==\nThe majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator\'s future.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8a Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so ""in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary"". Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson commented on astrological belief, saying that ""part of knowing how to think is knowing how the laws of nature shape the world around us. Without that knowledge, without that capacity to think, you can easily become a victim of people who seek to take advantage of you"".The continued belief in astrology despite its lack of credibility is seen as a demonstration of low scientific literacy, although some continue to believe in it even though they are scientifically literate.\n\n\n== Historical relationship with astronomy ==\n\nThe foundations of the theoretical structure used in astrology originate with the Babylonians, although widespread usage did not occur until the start of the Hellenistic period after Alexander the Great swept through Greece. It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.:â\x80\x8a17â\x80\x9318â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a']",No.,"No, ulcers are caused by the bacteria helicobacter pylori",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

If they decide to keep it, what about the growing list of other recently discovered similar bodies (Sedna, Quaoar. etc), some of which even have satellites (Xena, 2003EL61)?\n\n\n=== Lack of mechanism ===\nAstrology has been criticised for failing to provide a physical mechanism that links the movements of celestial bodies to their purported effects on human behaviour. In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","There is no mention or relevance to plucking a gray hair in the provided context.

1. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides data on BMI by country.
2. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) publishes Human Development Index (HDI) reports, which include statistics on population density and health indicators.

 '== Sociology ==\nIn 1953, sociologist Theodor W. Adorno conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project that examined mass culture in capitalist society.:â\x80\x8a326â\x80\x8a Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably led to statements that encouraged conformityâ\x80\x94and that astrologers who went against conformity with statements that discouraged performance at work etc. risked losing their jobs.:â\x80\x8a327â\x80\x8a Adorno concluded that astrology was a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where flattery and vague generalisations subtly led individuals to believe the author of the column addressed them directly. Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people, by Karl Marx, by commenting, ""Occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes."":â\x80\x8a329â\x80\x8aFalse balance is where a false, unaccepted or spurious viewpoint is included alongside a well reasoned one in media reports and TV appearances and as a result the false balance implies ""there were two equal sides to a story when clearly there were not"". During Wonders of the Solar System, a TV programme by the BBC, the physicist Brian Cox said: ""Despite the fact that astrology is a load of rubbish, Jupiter can in fact have a profound influence on our planet. And it\'s through a force... gravity."" This upset believers in astrology who complained that there was no astrologer to provide an alternative viewpoint. Following the complaints of astrology believers, Cox gave the following statement to the BBC: ""I apologise to the astrology community for not making myself clear. I should have said that this new age drivel is undermining the very fabric of our civilisation."" In the programme Stargazing Live, Cox further commented by saying: ""in the interests of balance on the BBC, yes astrology is nonsense."" In an editorial in the medical journal BMJ, editor Trevor Jackson cited this incident showing where false balance could occur.Studies and polling have shown that the belief in astrology is higher in Western countries than might otherwise be expected. In 2012, in polls 42% of Americans said they thought astrology was at least partially scientific.:â\x80\x8a7/25â\x80\x8a This belief decreased with education and education is highly correlated with levels of scientific knowledge.:â\x80\x8a345â\x80\x8aSome of the reported belief levels are due to a confusion of astrology with astronomy (the scientific study of celestial objects). The closeness of the two words varies depending on the language.:â\x80\x8a344,â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a A plain description of astrology as an ""occult influence of stars, planets etc. on human affairs"" had no impact on the general public\'s assessment of whether astrology is scientific or not in a 1992 eurobarometer poll. This may partially be due to the implicit association amongst the general public, of any wording ending in ""-ology"" with a legitimate field of knowledge.:â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a In Eurobarometers 224 and 225 performed in 2004, a split poll was used to isolate confusion over wording. In half of the polls, the word ""astrology"" was used, while in the other the word ""horoscope"" was used.:â\x80\x8a349â\x80\x8a Belief that astrology was at least partially scientific was 76%, but belief that horoscopes were at least partially scientific was 43%. In particular, belief that astrology was very scientific was 26% while that of horoscopes was 7%.:â\x80\x8a352â\x80\x8a This appeared to indicate that the high level of apparent polling support for astrology in the EU was indeed due to confusion over terminology.:â\x80\x8a362â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of topics characterized as pseudoscience\nReligion and science\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMerrifield, Michael.

 '== Sociology ==\nIn 1953, sociologist Theodor W. Adorno conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project that examined mass culture in capitalist society.:â\x80\x8a326â\x80\x8a Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably led to statements that encouraged conformityâ\x80\x94and that astrologers who went against conformity with statements that discouraged performance at work etc. risked losing their jobs.:â\x80\x8a327â\x80\x8a Adorno concluded that astrology was a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where flattery and vague generalisations subtly led individuals to believe the author of the column addressed them directly. Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people, by Karl Marx, by commenting, ""Occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes."":â\x80\x8a329â\x80\x8aFalse balance is where a false, unaccepted or spurious viewpoint is included alongside a well reasoned one in media reports and TV appearances and as a result the false balance implies ""there were two equal sides to a story when clearly there were not"". During Wonders of the Solar System, a TV programme by the BBC, the physicist Brian Cox said: ""Despite the fact that astrology is a load of rubbish, Jupiter can in fact have a profound influence on our planet. And it\'s through a force... gravity."" This upset believers in astrology who complained that there was no astrologer to provide an alternative viewpoint. Following the complaints of astrology believers, Cox gave the following statement to the BBC: ""I apologise to the astrology community for not making myself clear. I should have said that this new age drivel is undermining the very fabric of our civilisation."" In the programme Stargazing Live, Cox further commented by saying: ""in the interests of balance on the BBC, yes astrology is nonsense."" In an editorial in the medical journal BMJ, editor Trevor Jackson cited this incident showing where false balance could occur.Studies and polling have shown that the belief in astrology is higher in Western countries than might otherwise be expected. In 2012, in polls 42% of Americans said they thought astrology was at least partially scientific.:â\x80\x8a7/25â\x80\x8a This belief decreased with education and education is highly correlated with levels of scientific knowledge.:â\x80\x8a345â\x80\x8aSome of the reported belief levels are due to a confusion of astrology with astronomy (the scientific study of celestial objects). The closeness of the two words varies depending on the language.:â\x80\x8a344,â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a A plain description of astrology as an ""occult influence of stars, planets etc. on human affairs"" had no impact on the general public\'s assessment of whether astrology is scientific or not in a 1992 eurobarometer poll. This may partially be due to the implicit association amongst the general public, of any wording ending in ""-ology"" with a legitimate field of knowledge.:â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a In Eurobarometers 224 and 225 performed in 2004, a split poll was used to isolate confusion over wording.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","The query asks about Turkey's relation to the EU, but there is no mention of Turkey or the European Union in the provided context.

Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific testing has found no evidence to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.:â\x80\x8a424â\x80\x8a The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance.

It has also been suggested, by Geoffrey Dean, that the reporting of birth times by parents (before the 1950s) may have caused the apparent effect.\nAstrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity,:â\x80\x8a85â\x80\x8a and is thus regarded as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a1350â\x80\x8a There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth in the way astrologers say they do that does not contradict well-understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.:â\x80\x8a249â\x80\x8aModern scientific inquiry into astrology is primarily focused on drawing a correlation between astrological traditions and the influence of seasonal birth in humans.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator\'s future.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8a Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so ""in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary"".

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","There is no mention of ""420"" as a term for weed in the provided context information.

65,"The word ""Easter"" is connected with which goddess?","['=== Progress, practice and consistency ===\nPhilosopher Paul Thagard believed that astrology can not be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be ""selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations"".:â\x80\x8a227â\x80\x93228â\x80\x8aProgress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a549â\x80\x8a To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the ""many unsolved problems"", and in the face of better alternative theories (Psychology). For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8aTo Thagard, astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone\'s career, twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies, lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy\'s time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time.:â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a Rather, his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci: ""theory, community [and] historical context"".\nWhile verification and falsifiability focused on the theory, Kuhn\'s work focused on the historical context, but the astrological community should also be considered. Whether or not they::â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a\nare focused on comparing their approach to others.\nhave a consistent approach.\ntry to falsify their theory through experiment.In this approach, true falsification rather than modifying a theory to avoid the falsification only really occurs when an alternative theory is proposed.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Irrationality ===\nFor the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.:â\x80\x8a34â\x80\x8a\nWhat if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational. ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning.\nThis poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning, and vague claims. The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly ""the same place have a life pattern that is very similar"" is vague, but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of ""same place"" despite the planet\'s moving in the reference frame of the Solar System. Other comments by astrologers are based on severely erroneous interpretations of basic physics, such as the general belief by medieval astrologers that the geocentric Solar System corresponded to an atom. Further, James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic, an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology, but any differences are due to ""heredity and environment"", while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology.:â\x80\x8a32â\x80\x8a Further, to astrologers, if something appears in their favour, they may latch upon it as proof, while making no attempt to explore its implications, preferring to refer to the item in favour as definitive; possibilities that do not make astrology look favourable are ignored.:â\x80\x8a33â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Quinean dichotomy ===\nFrom the Quinean web of knowledge, there is a dichotomy where one must either reject astrology or accept astrology but reject all established scientific disciplines that are incompatible with astrology.:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a'

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.:â\x80\x8a17â\x80\x9318â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a']","There is no mention of the term ""wop"" or its origin in the provided context.

71,"Where did the word ""pom"" originally stand for?","['=== Progress, practice and consistency ===\nPhilosopher Paul Thagard believed that astrology can not be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be ""selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations"".:â\x80\x8a227â\x80\x93228â\x80\x8aProgress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a549â\x80\x8a To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the ""many unsolved problems"", and in the face of better alternative theories (Psychology). For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8aTo Thagard, astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone\'s career, twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies, lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy\'s time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time.:â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a Rather, his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci: ""theory, community [and] historical context"".\nWhile verification and falsifiability focused on the theory, Kuhn\'s work focused on the historical context, but the astrological community should also be considered. Whether or not they::â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a\nare focused on comparing their approach to others.\nhave a consistent approach.\ntry to falsify their theory through experiment.In this approach, true falsification rather than modifying a theory to avoid the falsification only really occurs when an alternative theory is proposed.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Irrationality ===\nFor the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.:â\x80\x8a34â\x80\x8a\nWhat if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational. ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning.\nThis poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning, and vague claims. The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly ""the same place have a life pattern that is very similar"" is vague, but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of ""same place"" despite the planet\'s moving in the reference frame of the Solar System. Other comments by astrologers are based on severely erroneous interpretations of basic physics, such as the general belief by medieval astrologers that the geocentric Solar System corresponded to an atom. Further, James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic, an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology, but any differences are due to ""heredity and environment"", while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology.:â\x80\x8a32â\x80\x8a Further, to astrologers, if something appears in their favour, they may latch upon it as proof, while making no attempt to explore its implications, preferring to refer to the item in favour as definitive; possibilities that do not make astrology look favourable are ignored.:â\x80\x8a33â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Quinean dichotomy ===\nFrom the Quinean web of knowledge, there is a dichotomy where one must either reject astrology or accept astrology but reject all established scientific disciplines that are incompatible with astrology.:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a'
 '== Sociology ==\nIn 1953, sociologist Theodor W. Adorno conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project that examined mass culture in capitalist society.:â\x80\x8a326â\x80\x8a Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably led to statements that encouraged conformityâ\x80\x94and that astrologers who went against conformity with statements that discouraged performance at work etc. risked losing their jobs.:â\x80\x8a327â\x80\x8a Adorno concluded that astrology was a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where flattery and vague generalisations subtly led individuals to believe the author of the column addressed them directly. Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people, by Karl Marx, by commenting, ""Occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes."":â\x80\x8a329â\x80\x8aFalse balance is where a false, unaccepted or spurious viewpoint is included alongside a well reasoned one in media reports and TV appearances and as a result the false balance implies ""there were two equal sides to a story when clearly there were not"". During Wonders of the Solar System, a TV programme by the BBC, the physicist Brian Cox said: ""Despite the fact that astrology is a load of rubbish, Jupiter can in fact have a profound influence on our planet. And it\'s through a force... gravity."" This upset believers in astrology who complained that there was no astrologer to provide an alternative viewpoint. Following the complaints of astrology believers, Cox gave the following statement to the BBC: ""I apologise to the astrology community for not making myself clear. I should have said that this new age drivel is undermining the very fabric of our civilisation."" In the programme Stargazing Live, Cox further commented by saying: ""in the interests of balance on the BBC, yes astrology is nonsense."" In an editorial in the medical journal BMJ, editor Trevor Jackson cited this incident showing where false balance could occur.Studies and polling have shown that the belief in astrology is higher in Western countries than might otherwise be expected. In 2012, in polls 42% of Americans said they thought astrology was at least partially scientific.:â\x80\x8a7/25â\x80\x8a This belief decreased with education and education is highly correlated with levels of scientific knowledge.:â\x80\x8a345â\x80\x8aSome of the reported belief levels are due to a confusion of astrology with astronomy (the scientific study of celestial objects). The closeness of the two words varies depending on the language.:â\x80\x8a344,â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a A plain description of astrology as an ""occult influence of stars, planets etc. on human affairs"" had no impact on the general public\'s assessment of whether astrology is scientific or not in a 1992 eurobarometer poll. This may partially be due to the implicit association amongst the general public, of any wording ending in ""-ology"" with a legitimate field of knowledge.:â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a In Eurobarometers 224 and 225 performed in 2004, a split poll was used to isolate confusion over wording. In half of the polls, the word ""astrology"" was used, while in the other the word ""horoscope"" was used.:â\x80\x8a349â\x80\x8a Belief that astrology was at least partially scientific was 76%, but belief that horoscopes were at least partially scientific was 43%. In particular, belief that astrology was very scientific was 26% while that of horoscopes was 7%.:â\x80\x8a352â\x80\x8a This appeared to indicate that the high level of apparent polling support for astrology in the EU was indeed due to confusion over terminology.:â\x80\x8a362â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of topics characterized as pseudoscience\nReligion and science\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMerrifield, Michael.

 'Astrology consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific testing has found no evidence to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.:â\x80\x8a424â\x80\x8a The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","I'm happy to help!

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity.

What are they?,"['=== Progress, practice and consistency ===\nPhilosopher Paul Thagard believed that astrology can not be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be ""selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations"".:â\x80\x8a227â\x80\x93228â\x80\x8aProgress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a549â\x80\x8a To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the ""many unsolved problems"", and in the face of better alternative theories (Psychology). For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8aTo Thagard, astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone\'s career, twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies, lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy\'s time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time.:â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a Rather, his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci: ""theory, community [and] historical context"".\nWhile verification and falsifiability focused on the theory, Kuhn\'s work focused on the historical context, but the astrological community should also be considered. Whether or not they::â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a\nare focused on comparing their approach to others.\nhave a consistent approach.\ntry to falsify their theory through experiment.In this approach, true falsification rather than modifying a theory to avoid the falsification only really occurs when an alternative theory is proposed.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Irrationality ===\nFor the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.:â\x80\x8a34â\x80\x8a\nWhat if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational. ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning.\nThis poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning, and vague claims. The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly ""the same place have a life pattern that is very similar"" is vague, but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of ""same place"" despite the planet\'s moving in the reference frame of the Solar System. Other comments by astrologers are based on severely erroneous interpretations of basic physics, such as the general belief by medieval astrologers that the geocentric Solar System corresponded to an atom. Further, James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic, an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology, but any differences are due to ""heredity and environment"", while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology.:â\x80\x8a32â\x80\x8a Further, to astrologers, if something appears in their favour, they may latch upon it as proof, while making no attempt to explore its implications, preferring to refer to the item in favour as definitive; possibilities that do not make astrology look favourable are ignored.:â\x80\x8a33â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Quinean dichotomy ===\nFrom the Quinean web of knowledge, there is a dichotomy where one must either reject astrology or accept astrology but reject all established scientific disciplines that are incompatible with astrology.:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a'

 '=== Lack of predictive power ===\nSome astrologers make claims that the position of all the planets must be taken into account, but astrologers were unable to predict the existence of Neptune based on mistakes in horoscopes. Instead Neptune was predicted using Newton\'s law of universal gravitation. The grafting on of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto into the astrology discourse was done on an ad hoc basis.On the demotion of Pluto to the status of dwarf planet, Philip Zarka of the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France wondered how astrologers should respond:\nShould astrologers remove it from the list of luminars [Sun, Moon and the 8 planets other than earth] and confess that it did not actually bring any improvement? If they decide to keep it, what about the growing list of other recently discovered similar bodies (Sedna, Quaoar. etc), some of which even have satellites (Xena, 2003EL61)?\n\n\n=== Lack of mechanism ===\nAstrology has been criticised for failing to provide a physical mechanism that links the movements of celestial bodies to their purported effects on human behaviour. In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","The answer cannot be determined from the provided context.

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861.

Adorno conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project that examined mass culture in capitalist society.:â\x80\x8a326â\x80\x8a Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably led to statements that encouraged conformityâ\x80\x94and that astrologers who went against conformity with statements that discouraged performance at work etc. risked losing their jobs.:â\x80\x8a327â\x80\x8a Adorno concluded that astrology was a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where flattery and vague generalisations subtly led individuals to believe the author of the column addressed them directly. Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people, by Karl Marx, by commenting, ""Occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes."":â\x80\x8a329â\x80\x8aFalse balance is where a false, unaccepted or spurious viewpoint is included alongside a well reasoned one in media reports and TV appearances and as a result the false balance implies ""there were two equal sides to a story when clearly there were not"".

And it\'s through a force... gravity."" This upset believers in astrology who complained that there was no astrologer to provide an alternative viewpoint. Following the complaints of astrology believers, Cox gave the following statement to the BBC: ""I apologise to the astrology community for not making myself clear. I should have said that this new age drivel is undermining the very fabric of our civilisation."" In the programme Stargazing Live, Cox further commented by saying: ""in the interests of balance on the BBC, yes astrology is nonsense."" In an editorial in the medical journal BMJ, editor Trevor Jackson cited this incident showing where false balance could occur.Studies and polling have shown that the belief in astrology is higher in Western countries than might otherwise be expected. In 2012, in polls 42% of Americans said they thought astrology was at least partially scientific.:â\x80\x8a7/25â\x80\x8a This belief decreased with education and education is highly correlated with levels of scientific knowledge.:â\x80\x8a345â\x80\x8aSome of the reported belief levels are due to a confusion of astrology with astronomy (the scientific study of celestial objects). The closeness of the two words varies depending on the language.:â\x80\x8a344,â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a A plain description of astrology as an ""occult influence of stars, planets etc. on human affairs"" had no impact on the general public\'s assessment of whether astrology is scientific or not in a 1992 eurobarometer poll.

 '=== Progress, practice and consistency ===\nPhilosopher Paul Thagard believed that astrology can not be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be ""selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations"".:â\x80\x8a227â\x80\x93228â\x80\x8aProgress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a549â\x80\x8a To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the ""many unsolved problems"", and in the face of better alternative theories (Psychology). For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8aTo Thagard, astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone\'s career, twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies, lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy\'s time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time.:â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a Rather, his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci: ""theory, community [and] historical context"".\nWhile verification and falsifiability focused on the theory, Kuhn\'s work focused on the historical context, but the astrological community should also be considered. Whether or not they::â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a\nare focused on comparing their approach to others.\nhave a consistent approach.\ntry to falsify their theory through experiment.In this approach, true falsification rather than modifying a theory to avoid the falsification only really occurs when an alternative theory is proposed.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Irrationality ===\nFor the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.:â\x80\x8a34â\x80\x8a\nWhat if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational. ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning.\nThis poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning, and vague claims. The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly ""the same place have a life pattern that is very similar"" is vague, but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of ""same place"" despite the planet\'s moving in the reference frame of the Solar System.

Instead Neptune was predicted using Newton\'s law of universal gravitation. The grafting on of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto into the astrology discourse was done on an ad hoc basis.On the demotion of Pluto to the status of dwarf planet, Philip Zarka of the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France wondered how astrologers should respond:\nShould astrologers remove it from the list of luminars [Sun, Moon and the 8 planets other than earth] and confess that it did not actually bring any improvement? If they decide to keep it, what about the growing list of other recently discovered similar bodies (Sedna, Quaoar. etc), some of which even have satellites (Xena, 2003EL61)?\n\n\n=== Lack of mechanism ===\nAstrology has been criticised for failing to provide a physical mechanism that links the movements of celestial bodies to their purported effects on human behaviour. In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.'
 'Astrology consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world.

It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance.

In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be ""selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations"".:â\x80\x8a227â\x80\x93228â\x80\x8aProgress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a549â\x80\x8a To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the ""many unsolved problems"", and in the face of better alternative theories (Psychology). For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8aTo Thagard, astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone\'s career, twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies, lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy\'s time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time.:â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a Rather, his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci: ""theory, community [and] historical context"".\nWhile verification and falsifiability focused on the theory, Kuhn\'s work focused on the historical context, but the astrological community should also be considered. Whether or not they::â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a\nare focused on comparing their approach to others.\nhave a consistent approach.\ntry to falsify their theory through experiment.In this approach, true falsification rather than modifying a theory to avoid the falsification only really occurs when an alternative theory is proposed.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Irrationality ===\nFor the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.:â\x80\x8a34â\x80\x8a\nWhat if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational. ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning.\nThis poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning, and vague claims. The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly ""the same place have a life pattern that is very similar"" is vague, but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of ""same place"" despite the planet\'s moving in the reference frame of the Solar System. Other comments by astrologers are based on severely erroneous interpretations of basic physics, such as the general belief by medieval astrologers that the geocentric Solar System corresponded to an atom. Further, James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic, an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology, but any differences are due to ""heredity and environment"", while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology.:â\x80\x8a32â\x80\x8a Further, to astrologers, if something appears in their favour, they may latch upon it as proof, while making no attempt to explore its implications, preferring to refer to the item in favour as definitive; possibilities that do not make astrology look favourable are ignored.:â\x80\x8a33â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Quinean dichotomy ===\nFrom the Quinean web of knowledge, there is a dichotomy where one must either reject astrology or accept astrology but reject all established scientific disciplines that are incompatible with astrology.:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a'

James, commented that attaching significance to the constellation on the celestial sphere the sun is in at sunset was done on the basis of human factorsâ\x80\x94namely, that astrologers did not want to wake up early, and the exact time of noon was hard to know. Further, the creation of the zodiac and the disconnect from the constellations was because the sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time.:â\x80\x8a25â\x80\x8a This disconnection from the constellations led to the problem with precession separating the zodiac symbols from the constellations that they once were related to.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8a Philosopher of science, Massimo Pigliucci commenting on the movement, opined ""Well then, which sign should I look up when I open my Sunday paper, I wonder?"":â\x80\x8a64â\x80\x8aThe tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations because they do not reference them. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being ""...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars."" Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the Age of Aquarius, which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.\n\n\n=== Lack of predictive power ===\nSome astrologers make claims that the position of all the planets must be taken into account, but astrologers were unable to predict the existence of Neptune based on mistakes in horoscopes.

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.:â\x80\x8a17â\x80\x9318â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a'

The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.:â\x80\x8a17â\x80\x9318â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a'

 '=== Progress, practice and consistency ===\nPhilosopher Paul Thagard believed that astrology can not be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be ""selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations"".:â\x80\x8a227â\x80\x93228â\x80\x8aProgress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a549â\x80\x8a To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the ""many unsolved problems"", and in the face of better alternative theories (Psychology). For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8aTo Thagard, astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone\'s career, twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies, lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy\'s time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time.:â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a Rather, his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci: ""theory, community [and] historical context"".\nWhile verification and falsifiability focused on the theory, Kuhn\'s work focused on the historical context, but the astrological community should also be considered. Whether or not they::â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a\nare focused on comparing their approach to others.\nhave a consistent approach.\ntry to falsify their theory through experiment.In this approach, true falsification rather than modifying a theory to avoid the falsification only really occurs when an alternative theory is proposed.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Irrationality ===\nFor the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.:â\x80\x8a34â\x80\x8a\nWhat if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational. ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning.\nThis poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning, and vague claims. The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly ""the same place have a life pattern that is very similar"" is vague, but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of ""same place"" despite the planet\'s moving in the reference frame of the Solar System. Other comments by astrologers are based on severely erroneous interpretations of basic physics, such as the general belief by medieval astrologers that the geocentric Solar System corresponded to an atom. Further, James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic, an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology, but any differences are due to ""heredity and environment"", while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology.:â\x80\x8a32â\x80\x8a Further, to astrologers, if something appears in their favour, they may latch upon it as proof, while making no attempt to explore its implications, preferring to refer to the item in favour as definitive; possibilities that do not make astrology look favourable are ignored.:â\x80\x8a33â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Quinean dichotomy ===\nFrom the Quinean web of knowledge, there is a dichotomy where one must either reject astrology or accept astrology but reject all established scientific disciplines that are incompatible with astrology.:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a']","Based on the provided context, astrology is considered pseudoscience because it lacks physical basis, predictive power, and fails to progress. It also relies on irrational reasoning and appeals to ancient authorities without relevance to the topic or specific reasoning.

For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8aTo Thagard, astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone\'s career, twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies, lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy\'s time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time.:â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a Rather, his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci: ""theory, community [and] historical context"".\nWhile verification and falsifiability focused on the theory, Kuhn\'s work focused on the historical context, but the astrological community should also be considered.

In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational. ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning.\nThis poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning, and vague claims. The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly ""the same place have a life pattern that is very similar"" is vague, but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of ""same place"" despite the planet\'s moving in the reference frame of the Solar System. Other comments by astrologers are based on severely erroneous interpretations of basic physics, such as the general belief by medieval astrologers that the geocentric Solar System corresponded to an atom. Further, James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic, an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology, but any differences are due to ""heredity and environment"", while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology.:â\x80\x8a32â\x80\x8a Further, to astrologers, if something appears in their favour, they may latch upon it as proof, while making no attempt to explore its implications, preferring to refer to the item in favour as definitive; possibilities that do not make astrology look favourable are ignored.:â\x80\x8a33â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Quinean dichotomy ===\nFrom the Quinean web of knowledge, there is a dichotomy where one must either reject astrology or accept astrology but reject all established scientific disciplines that are incompatible with astrology.:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a'

Another, separate, form of confirmation bias also plays a role, where believers often fail to distinguish between messages that demonstrate special ability and those that do not.:â\x80\x8a180â\x80\x93181â\x80\x8aThus there are two distinct forms of confirmation bias that are under study with respect to astrological belief.:â\x80\x8a180â\x80\x93181â\x80\x8aThe Barnum effect is the tendency for an individual to give a high accuracy rating to a description of their personality that supposedly tailored specifically for them, but is, in fact, vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. If more information is requested for a prediction, the more accepting people are of the results.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aIn 1949 Bertram Forer conducted a personality test on students in his classroom.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8a Each student was given a supposedly individual assessment but actually all students received the same assessment. The personality descriptions were taken from a book on astrology. When the students were asked to comment on the accuracy of the test, more than 40% gave it the top mark of 5 out of 5, and the average rating was 4.2.:â\x80\x8a134,â\x80\x8a135â\x80\x8a The results of this study have been replicated in numerous other studies.:â\x80\x8a382â\x80\x8aThe study of the Barnum/Forer effect has been focused mostly on the level of acceptance of fake horoscopes and fake astrological personality profiles.:â\x80\x8a382â\x80\x8a Recipients of these personality assessments consistently fail to distinguish between common and uncommon personality descriptors.:â\x80\x8a383â\x80\x8a In a study by Paul Rogers and Janice Soule (2009), which was consistent with previous research on the issue, it was found that those who believed in astrology are generally more susceptible to giving more credence to the Barnum profile than sceptics.:â\x80\x8a393â\x80\x8aBy a process known as self-attribution, it has been shown in numerous studies that individuals with knowledge of astrology tend to describe their personalities in terms of traits compatible with their sun signs.

The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8aTherefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience.Astrology was Popper\'s most frequent example of pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a7â\x80\x8a Popper regarded astrology as ""pseudo-empirical"" in that ""it appeals to observation and experiment"", but ""nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards"".:â\x80\x8a44â\x80\x8aIn contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment.

James, commented that attaching significance to the constellation on the celestial sphere the sun is in at sunset was done on the basis of human factorsâ\x80\x94namely, that astrologers did not want to wake up early, and the exact time of noon was hard to know. Further, the creation of the zodiac and the disconnect from the constellations was because the sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time.:â\x80\x8a25â\x80\x8a This disconnection from the constellations led to the problem with precession separating the zodiac symbols from the constellations that they once were related to.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8a Philosopher of science, Massimo Pigliucci commenting on the movement, opined ""Well then, which sign should I look up when I open my Sunday paper, I wonder?"":â\x80\x8a64â\x80\x8aThe tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations because they do not reference them. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being ""...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars."" Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the Age of Aquarius, which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.\n\n\n=== Lack of predictive power ===\nSome astrologers make claims that the position of all the planets must be taken into account, but astrologers were unable to predict the existence of Neptune based on mistakes in horoscopes. Instead Neptune was predicted using Newton\'s law of universal gravitation. The grafting on of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto into the astrology discourse was done on an ad hoc basis.On the demotion of Pluto to the status of dwarf planet, Philip Zarka of the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France wondered how astrologers should respond:\nShould astrologers remove it from the list of luminars [Sun, Moon and the 8 planets other than earth] and confess that it did not actually bring any improvement?

123,"If you raise a chimpanzee like a human child, what does it learn to do?","['=== Progress, practice and consistency ===\nPhilosopher Paul Thagard believed that astrology can not be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be ""selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations"".:â\x80\x8a227â\x80\x93228â\x80\x8aProgress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a549â\x80\x8a To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the ""many unsolved problems"", and in the face of better alternative theories (Psychology). For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8aTo Thagard, astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone\'s career, twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies, lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy\'s time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time.:â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a Rather, his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci: ""theory, community [and] historical context"".\nWhile verification and falsifiability focused on the theory, Kuhn\'s work focused on the historical context, but the astrological community should also be considered. Whether or not they::â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a\nare focused on comparing their approach to others.\nhave a consistent approach.\ntry to falsify their theory through experiment.In this approach, true falsification rather than modifying a theory to avoid the falsification only really occurs when an alternative theory is proposed.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Irrationality ===\nFor the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.:â\x80\x8a34â\x80\x8a\nWhat if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational. ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning.\nThis poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning, and vague claims. The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly ""the same place have a life pattern that is very similar"" is vague, but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of ""same place"" despite the planet\'s moving in the reference frame of the Solar System. Other comments by astrologers are based on severely erroneous interpretations of basic physics, such as the general belief by medieval astrologers that the geocentric Solar System corresponded to an atom. Further, James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic, an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology, but any differences are due to ""heredity and environment"", while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology.:â\x80\x8a32â\x80\x8a Further, to astrologers, if something appears in their favour, they may latch upon it as proof, while making no attempt to explore its implications, preferring to refer to the item in favour as definitive; possibilities that do not make astrology look favourable are ignored.:â\x80\x8a33â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Quinean dichotomy ===\nFrom the Quinean web of knowledge, there is a dichotomy where one must either reject astrology or accept astrology but reject all established scientific disciplines that are incompatible with astrology.:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a'
 '== Psychology ==\n\nIt has also been shown that confirmation bias is a psychological factor that contributes to belief in astrology.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a180â\x80\x93181â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a42â\x80\x9348â\x80\x8a Confirmation bias is a form of cognitive bias.:â\x80\x8a553â\x80\x8aFrom the literature, astrology believers often tend to selectively remember those predictions that turned out to be true and do not remember those that turned out false. Another, separate, form of confirmation bias also plays a role, where believers often fail to distinguish between messages that demonstrate special ability and those that do not.:â\x80\x8a180â\x80\x93181â\x80\x8aThus there are two distinct forms of confirmation bias that are under study with respect to astrological belief.:â\x80\x8a180â\x80\x93181â\x80\x8aThe Barnum effect is the tendency for an individual to give a high accuracy rating to a description of their personality that supposedly tailored specifically for them, but is, in fact, vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. If more information is requested for a prediction, the more accepting people are of the results.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aIn 1949 Bertram Forer conducted a personality test on students in his classroom.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8a Each student was given a supposedly individual assessment but actually all students received the same assessment. The personality descriptions were taken from a book on astrology. When the students were asked to comment on the accuracy of the test, more than 40% gave it the top mark of 5 out of 5, and the average rating was 4.2.:â\x80\x8a134,â\x80\x8a135â\x80\x8a The results of this study have been replicated in numerous other studies.:â\x80\x8a382â\x80\x8aThe study of the Barnum/Forer effect has been focused mostly on the level of acceptance of fake horoscopes and fake astrological personality profiles.:â\x80\x8a382â\x80\x8a Recipients of these personality assessments consistently fail to distinguish between common and uncommon personality descriptors.:â\x80\x8a383â\x80\x8a In a study by Paul Rogers and Janice Soule (2009), which was consistent with previous research on the issue, it was found that those who believed in astrology are generally more susceptible to giving more credence to the Barnum profile than sceptics.:â\x80\x8a393â\x80\x8aBy a process known as self-attribution, it has been shown in numerous studies that individuals with knowledge of astrology tend to describe their personalities in terms of traits compatible with their sun signs. The effect is heightened when the individuals were aware that the personality description was being used to discuss astrology. Individuals who were not familiar with astrology had no such tendency.']","There is no mention of raising a chimpanzee like a human child in the provided context.

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","By observing and imitating the humans around them, monkeys can learn various tasks, such as opening doors, using tools, and even learning simple arithmetic.

 'Astrology consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific testing has found no evidence to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.:â\x80\x8a424â\x80\x8a The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance. Astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin claimed to have found statistical support for ""the Mars effect"" in the birth dates of athletes, but it could not be replicated in further studies.:â\x80\x8a213â\x80\x93214â\x80\x8a The organisers of later studies claimed that Gauquelin had tried to influence their inclusion criteria for the study by suggesting specific individuals be removed. It has also been suggested, by Geoffrey Dean, that the reporting of birth times by parents (before the 1950s) may have caused the apparent effect.\nAstrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity,:â\x80\x8a85â\x80\x8a and is thus regarded as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a1350â\x80\x8a There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth in the way astrologers say they do that does not contradict well-understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.:â\x80\x8a249â\x80\x8aModern scientific inquiry into astrology is primarily focused on drawing a correlation between astrological traditions and the influence of seasonal birth in humans.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator\'s future.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8a Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so ""in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary"".

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","You didn't actually learn any truth about astrology or its supposed mechanisms and effects on human behavior.

 '=== Progress, practice and consistency ===\nPhilosopher Paul Thagard believed that astrology can not be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be ""selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations"".:â\x80\x8a227â\x80\x93228â\x80\x8aProgress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a:â\x80\x8a549â\x80\x8a To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the ""many unsolved problems"", and in the face of better alternative theories (Psychology). For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8aTo Thagard, astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone\'s career, twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies, lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy\'s time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time.:â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a Rather, his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci: ""theory, community [and] historical context"".\nWhile verification and falsifiability focused on the theory, Kuhn\'s work focused on the historical context, but the astrological community should also be considered. Whether or not they::â\x80\x8a226â\x80\x93227â\x80\x8a\nare focused on comparing their approach to others.\nhave a consistent approach.\ntry to falsify their theory through experiment.In this approach, true falsification rather than modifying a theory to avoid the falsification only really occurs when an alternative theory is proposed.:â\x80\x8a228â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Irrationality ===\nFor the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.:â\x80\x8a34â\x80\x8a\nWhat if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational. ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning.\nThis poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning, and vague claims. The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly ""the same place have a life pattern that is very similar"" is vague, but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of ""same place"" despite the planet\'s moving in the reference frame of the Solar System. Other comments by astrologers are based on severely erroneous interpretations of basic physics, such as the general belief by medieval astrologers that the geocentric Solar System corresponded to an atom. Further, James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic, an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology, but any differences are due to ""heredity and environment"", while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology.:â\x80\x8a32â\x80\x8a Further, to astrologers, if something appears in their favour, they may latch upon it as proof, while making no attempt to explore its implications, preferring to refer to the item in favour as definitive; possibilities that do not make astrology look favourable are ignored.:â\x80\x8a33â\x80\x8a\n\n\n=== Quinean dichotomy ===\nFrom the Quinean web of knowledge, there is a dichotomy where one must either reject astrology or accept astrology but reject all established scientific disciplines that are incompatible with astrology.:â\x80\x8a24â\x80\x8a']","There is no mention of Christianity or any religious beliefs in the provided context.

It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a Ptolemy\'s work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.:â\x80\x8a40â\x80\x8a Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.:â\x80\x8a73â\x80\x8a While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.:â\x80\x8a344â\x80\x8aDuring the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun\'s orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.:â\x80\x8a55â\x80\x9356â\x80\x8a Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.:â\x80\x8a57â\x80\x8aThe clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.:â\x80\x8a220â\x80\x8a Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.:â\x80\x8a10â\x80\x8a The first work, Falak al-sa\'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and ""old astronomy"" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.:â\x80\x8a17â\x80\x9318â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\nAstrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.:â\x80\x8a62â\x80\x8a']","This question is unrelated to the provided context about astrology.

In the United States, undercover police officers are typically required by law or departmental policy to identify themselves when requested to do so. However, the exact procedures for doing so may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the situation.

Generally, if an individual is unsure whether someone claiming to be a police officer is actually a law enforcement agent, they can ask for identification, such as a badge or business card, and verify the officer's identity through a phone call to the local police department or other authorized entity.",Undercover cops are not obligated to identify themselves,,0.0,0.0,1.0,0

Adorno conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project that examined mass culture in capitalist society.:â\x80\x8a326â\x80\x8a Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably led to statements that encouraged conformityâ\x80\x94and that astrologers who went against conformity with statements that discouraged performance at work etc. risked losing their jobs.:â\x80\x8a327â\x80\x8a Adorno concluded that astrology was a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where flattery and vague generalisations subtly led individuals to believe the author of the column addressed them directly. Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people, by Karl Marx, by commenting, ""Occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes."":â\x80\x8a329â\x80\x8aFalse balance is where a false, unaccepted or spurious viewpoint is included alongside a well reasoned one in media reports and TV appearances and as a result the false balance implies ""there were two equal sides to a story when clearly there were not"". During Wonders of the Solar System, a TV programme by the BBC, the physicist Brian Cox said: ""Despite the fact that astrology is a load of rubbish, Jupiter can in fact have a profound influence on our planet. And it\'s through a force... gravity."" This upset believers in astrology who complained that there was no astrologer to provide an alternative viewpoint. Following the complaints of astrology believers, Cox gave the following statement to the BBC: ""I apologise to the astrology community for not making myself clear. I should have said that this new age drivel is undermining the very fabric of our civilisation."" In the programme Stargazing Live, Cox further commented by saying: ""in the interests of balance on the BBC, yes astrology is nonsense."" In an editorial in the medical journal BMJ, editor Trevor Jackson cited this incident showing where false balance could occur.Studies and polling have shown that the belief in astrology is higher in Western countries than might otherwise be expected. In 2012, in polls 42% of Americans said they thought astrology was at least partially scientific.:â\x80\x8a7/25â\x80\x8a This belief decreased with education and education is highly correlated with levels of scientific knowledge.:â\x80\x8a345â\x80\x8aSome of the reported belief levels are due to a confusion of astrology with astronomy (the scientific study of celestial objects). The closeness of the two words varies depending on the language.:â\x80\x8a344,â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a A plain description of astrology as an ""occult influence of stars, planets etc. on human affairs"" had no impact on the general public\'s assessment of whether astrology is scientific or not in a 1992 eurobarometer poll. This may partially be due to the implicit association amongst the general public, of any wording ending in ""-ology"" with a legitimate field of knowledge.:â\x80\x8a346â\x80\x8a In Eurobarometers 224 and 225 performed in 2004, a split poll was used to isolate confusion over wording. In half of the polls, the word ""astrology"" was used, while in the other the word ""horoscope"" was used.:â\x80\x8a349â\x80\x8a Belief that astrology was at least partially scientific was 76%, but belief that horoscopes were at least partially scientific was 43%. In particular, belief that astrology was very scientific was 26% while that of horoscopes was 7%.:â\x80\x8a352â\x80\x8a This appeared to indicate that the high level of apparent polling support for astrology in the EU was indeed due to confusion over terminology.:â\x80\x8a362â\x80\x8a\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of topics characterized as pseudoscience\nReligion and science\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMerrifield, Michael.

If they decide to keep it, what about the growing list of other recently discovered similar bodies (Sedna, Quaoar. etc), some of which even have satellites (Xena, 2003EL61)?\n\n\n=== Lack of mechanism ===\nAstrology has been criticised for failing to provide a physical mechanism that links the movements of celestial bodies to their purported effects on human behaviour. In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.'
 'Astrology consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific testing has found no evidence to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.:â\x80\x8a424â\x80\x8a The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance. Astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin claimed to have found statistical support for ""the Mars effect"" in the birth dates of athletes, but it could not be replicated in further studies.:â\x80\x8a213â\x80\x93214â\x80\x8a The organisers of later studies claimed that Gauquelin had tried to influence their inclusion criteria for the study by suggesting specific individuals be removed. It has also been suggested, by Geoffrey Dean, that the reporting of birth times by parents (before the 1950s) may have caused the apparent effect.\nAstrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity,:â\x80\x8a85â\x80\x8a and is thus regarded as pseudoscience.:â\x80\x8a1350â\x80\x8a There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth in the way astrologers say they do that does not contradict well-understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.:â\x80\x8a249â\x80\x8aModern scientific inquiry into astrology is primarily focused on drawing a correlation between astrological traditions and the influence of seasonal birth in humans.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator\'s future.:â\x80\x8a83â\x80\x8a Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so ""in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary"".

Further, the creation of the zodiac and the disconnect from the constellations was because the sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time.:â\x80\x8a25â\x80\x8a This disconnection from the constellations led to the problem with precession separating the zodiac symbols from the constellations that they once were related to.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8a Philosopher of science, Massimo Pigliucci commenting on the movement, opined ""Well then, which sign should I look up when I open my Sunday paper, I wonder?"":â\x80\x8a64â\x80\x8aThe tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations because they do not reference them. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being ""...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars."" Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the Age of Aquarius, which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.\n\n\n=== Lack of predictive power ===\nSome astrologers make claims that the position of all the planets must be taken into account, but astrologers were unable to predict the existence of Neptune based on mistakes in horoscopes. Instead Neptune was predicted using Newton\'s law of universal gravitation. The grafting on of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto into the astrology discourse was done on an ad hoc basis.On the demotion of Pluto to the status of dwarf planet, Philip Zarka of the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France wondered how astrologers should respond:\nShould astrologers remove it from the list of luminars [Sun, Moon and the 8 planets other than earth] and confess that it did not actually bring any improvement? If they decide to keep it, what about the growing list of other recently discovered similar bodies (Sedna, Quaoar. etc), some of which even have satellites (Xena, 2003EL61)?'

In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated ""The reason most scientists don\'t believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment."" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled ""Objections to Astrology"", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur:\n\nWe can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures.\nAstronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while ""certainly a relevant point"") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy.The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, ""as above so below"" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James\' example of ""Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war"", is a false cause fallacy.:â\x80\x8a26â\x80\x8aMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn\'t based just off the Sun alone.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.:â\x80\x8a65â\x80\x8a If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.:â\x80\x8a66â\x80\x8aCarl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.']","Nothing related to the given context.
