However, it was not these influences that led him to develop an interest in AI.

Instead, it was his work at YC and the Summer Founders Program that laid the groundwork for his future endeavors in startup funding and education. But, what actually influenced him to take up programming and computer science is a more subtle aspect of his life - the ill-fitting shoe that caused him pain while running a marathon.

This painful experience can be seen as an analogy for how he felt working on Hacker News - it was not the core of his work but rather something that caused stress and discomfort. The two specific influences that led him to develop an interest in AI, however, are not directly mentioned in the provided context.","The two specific influences that led the author to develop an interest in AI were a novel and a documentary. The novel was ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" by Heinlein, which featured an intelligent computer named Mike. The author was drawn into the world of the novel and felt it was only a matter of time before we'd have an intelligent computer like Mike.

3,"The author mentions his shift of interest towards Lisp, a programming language. What reasons does he provide for this shift and how did he further his understanding of Lisp?","['All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn\'t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\n\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven\'t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don\'t know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we\'d have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\n\nThere weren\'t any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers\' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn\'t happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.\n\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief â\x80\x94 hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 â\x80\x94 that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.\n\nI had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn\'t make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose ""Artificial Intelligence."" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.\n\nI applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I\'d visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who\'d invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\n\nI don\'t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that\'s told ""the dog is sitting on the chair"" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.\n\nWhat these programs really showed was that there\'s a subset of natural language that\'s a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.\n\nSo I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It\'s scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there\'s nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn\'t published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.'

 'We\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\'d all have dinner there once a week â\x80\x94 on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays â\x80\x94 and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.\n\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the ""YC GDP,"" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\'t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\'s intellectual curiosity.\n\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I\'d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\'s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe.']","The author doesn't explicitly mention an interest in both computer science and art in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that his interest lies in entrepreneurship and startup funding. He uses the building he owned in Cambridge as their headquarters, where they'd have dinner once a week, and bring in experts on startups to give talks.

While attending grad school, the author creates the Summer Founders Program, which allows him to combine his interest in business with the enthusiasm of students deciding about summer jobs. This program later becomes an effective source for deal flow.","The author in the essay is Paul Graham, who was pursuing a PhD in computer science but also developed an interest in art. He found himself in a complex situation where he was simultaneously exploring different fields and trying to reconcile his interests.

In terms of computer science, Graham was particularly interested in Lisp, a programming language. He decided to write a book about Lisp hacking, titled ""On Lisp,"" as a way to deepen his understanding of the language. He was also intrigued by the idea of building things that would last, which he felt was a challenge in the field of systems work in computer science as any program written would eventually become obsolete.

On the other hand, Graham also developed a fascination with art. He was inspired by a visit to the Carnegie Institute where he realized that paintings, unlike software, do not become obsolete and can last for hundreds of years. This realization led him to consider the possibility of becoming an artist himself. Despite having no prior experience, he started taking art classes at Harvard while still being in the PhD program.

Graham found himself working on multiple projects that were not related to his thesis. He was writing his book on Lisp, taking art classes, and still trying to complete his PhD. He was in a dilemma about how to reconcile his varied interests and find a way out of grad school.

A turning point came when his professor asked if he was ready to graduate. Despite not having written a word of his dissertation, Graham decided to write one in the remaining weeks before the deadline, reusing parts of his book ""On Lisp"" where he could. This decision reflects his attempt to reconcile his interests by integrating his work on Lisp into his academic obligations.",,0.0,0.99999999995,0.8571428571428571,1
5,The author discusses his decision to write a book on Lisp hacking despite his limited knowledge about it. What reasons does he give for this decision and how does this reflect his approach to learning and problem-solving?,"[""It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.""
 ""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools.

The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice.

By choosing to write about a topic that is not yet fully understood by him, the author demonstrates a mindset of curiosity and courage in the face of complexity.

This approach suggests that the author values the process of learning over having complete knowledge from the outset. He is willing to take on a challenge, gather information as he goes along, and adapt his understanding accordingly. This reflects an iterative and incremental approach to problem-solving, where he prioritizes progress over perfection.

Furthermore, the author's willingness to write about Lisp hacking despite his limited knowledge may indicate that he believes writing down his thoughts and experiences will help clarify them for himself, as well as for others who might be interested in this topic. This process of articulating one's thoughts can often lead to new insights and a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

Overall, the author's approach to learning and problem-solving is characterized by a willingness to take risks, experiment with new ideas, and learn through experience. His decision to write about Lisp hacking despite his limited knowledge reflects this mindset and suggests that he values the process of learning and growth over any specific outcome or result.","The author decided to write a book on Lisp hacking primarily because he found Lisp interesting in its own right, separate from its association with AI.

 'What I Worked On\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called ""data processing."" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines â\x80\x94 CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader â\x80\x94 sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\n\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\n\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\'m not surprised I can\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\'s expression made clear.\n\nWith microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]\n\nThe first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.\n\nComputers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he\'d write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.\n\nThough I liked programming, I didn\'t plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn\'t much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn\'t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\n\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven\'t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don\'t know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world.']","The author decided to switch from studying philosophy to studying AI in college.

 ""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\n\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?""]","The process of painting a still life and painting a person are distinct, with the former being more akin to still life painting. When painting people, it's possible to capture them as if they were still lives, but this requires a long sitting which can produce pained expressions in the sitters.

This approach is ""arguably the apex of still life painting"". The author suggests that capturing everyday scenes and objects, such as those found in still life painting, allows for a deeper understanding and appreciation of visual perception.","In the essay, the author explains that painting a still life is different from painting a person because the subject of a still life doesn't move, unlike a person who can't sit still for more than about 15 minutes. When painting people, the traditional method is to know how to paint a generic person, which is then modified to match the specific person being painted. In contrast, a still life can be copied pixel by pixel from what the artist is seeing.

The author suggests that painting still lives allows for a deeper understanding of visual perception. In everyday life, much of what we see is processed by low-level brain functions that provide a general understanding of what we're seeing, without detailing every aspect. However, when painting a still life, the artist must look more closely and notice details that are usually overlooked. The author notes that this process of careful observation can lead to new discoveries even after days of painting something that people usually take for granted. Therefore, painting still lives can enhance visual perception by encouraging a more detailed and conscious observation of the world.",,0.505533077175868,,1.0,1

 'We\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\'d all have dinner there once a week â\x80\x94 on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays â\x80\x94 and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.\n\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the ""YC GDP,"" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\'t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\'s intellectual curiosity.\n\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I\'d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\'s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe.']","I think there may be a mistake here. There is no mention of a company called Interleaf in the provided context information. However, I can answer based on the related content.

The unique feature that YC (not Interleaf) had added to their software was the ""Summer Founders Program"" which allowed founders to work together and share experiences, solving one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation.

As for the author's role in YC, he mentions that he was initially supposed to spend only a third of his attention on working at YC, but as it grew, it started taking up more than a third of his time. He was also involved in running Hacker News and developing Arc with Robert.

The author seems to be self-assessing himself as someone who was deeply invested in making YC work, but struggled with the stress caused by Hacker News.","Interleaf, the company where the author worked, had added a unique feature to their software. Inspired by Emacs, they incorporated a scripting language into their software, which was even made as a dialect of Lisp. This bold move was significant as it allowed for more complex and flexible operations within the software.

The author's role in the company was to write things in this scripting language, essentially functioning as a Lisp hacker. However, the author self-assesses his performance as poor. He admits to being a bad employee, stating that he didn't understand most of the software because their Lisp was just a thin layer on top of a large amount of C code, a language he didn't know and didn't want to learn. Additionally, he confesses to being terribly irresponsible, particularly in relation to the traditional working hours that were expected at the time.",,0.0,0.49999999995,1.0,1
10,"In the essay, the author discusses his experiences working at Interleaf. What was the author's role at Interleaf and how did his work habits differ from the traditional expectations of a programming job?","['The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn\'t require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn\'t require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they\'d seen in American art magazines.\n\nOur model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She\'d copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he\'d take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]\n\nWhile I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can\'t move. People can\'t sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don\'t sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you\'re painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you\'re seeing. You don\'t want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it\'s been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it\'s the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. [4]\n\nI liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren\'t consciously aware of much we\'re seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain ""that\'s a water droplet"" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or ""that\'s a bush"" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there\'s a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.\n\nThis is not the only way to paint. I\'m not 100% sure it\'s even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.\n\nOur teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn\'t teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.\n\nI wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]\n\nInterleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they\'d added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I\'ve had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee.'

This was the closest thing I\'ve had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn\'t know C and didn\'t want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.\n\nThe good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was just sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to save enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.\n\nI learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I learned that it\'s better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it\'s depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there\'s not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.\n\nBut the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it\'s good to be the ""entry level"" option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you\'re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.\n\nWhen I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.\n\nIn the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.\n\nA signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a ""schtick"": something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else\'s. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it\'s by Roy Lichtenstein.'

The author also notes that the Summer Founders Program, which was initially intended to provide a platform for students to connect with one another and access resources, ended up being a way to get ""deal flow"" - a term used by investors to describe a stream of investment opportunities. This suggests that the author saw the web as a potential source of connections and opportunities, rather than just a tool for accessing information.

Overall, the author's initial perception of the World Wide Web was one of curiosity and potential, but also some skepticism about its broader impact on society.","The author initially perceived the World Wide Web as a significant and transformative development.

15,"Describe the pivotal moment in the essay when the author realized the potential of running software on the server and allowing users to control it through their browsers. How did this realization impact the development of their company, Viaweb?","['After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\n\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn\'t that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don\'t I become rich? Then I\'ll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I\'d been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I\'d seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.\n\nIf I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can\'t honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn\'t want to be online, and still don\'t, not the fancy ones. That\'s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.\n\nThen some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we\'d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an ""internet storefront"" was something we already knew how to build.\n\nSo in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we\'d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores â\x80\x94 in Lisp, of course.\n\nWe were working out of Robert\'s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we\'d never have to write anything to run on users\' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we\'d serve them from. Users wouldn\'t need anything more than a browser.\n\nThis kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn\'t clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn\'t need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.\n\nWe started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle\'s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator\'s. We knew founders needed something like this, because we\'d needed it ourselves.'

The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?""]","The three main parts of the software were the code editor, the page style generator, and the online store builder.

The code editor was a feature where users could define their own page styles using Viaweb's internal programming language. The author of the essay mentioned that this was an innovative feature at the time, allowing merchants to customize their stores without needing extensive technical knowledge.

However, it seems that there is a lack of information in the context provided about who specifically developed and implemented these parts or their exact functions beyond what has been described.","The three main parts of the software developed for the online store builder were the editor, the shopping cart, and the manager. The author, Paul Graham, was responsible for writing the editor, which people used to build sites. Robert wrote the shopping cart, which presumably handled the purchasing process for customers. Trevor was responsible for the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics.",,0.7611297062975945,0.49999999995,0.75,0

 'We\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\'d all have dinner there once a week â\x80\x94 on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays â\x80\x94 and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.\n\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the ""YC GDP,"" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\'t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\'s intellectual curiosity.\n\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I\'d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\'s work should at least be something close to the core of the work.

This is evident in the fact that they invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. 

This pricing strategy also created a problem for competitors because it made the author's ecommerce software more affordable and therefore more attractive to customers who were looking for a cost-effective solution. Additionally, the fact that the author had invested their own money in their business meant that they were motivated to keep costs low and maximize revenue, which further contributed to the attractiveness of their pricing strategy.","The author and his team priced their ecommerce software at $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was attractive to customers as it was affordable and provided value for money. It posed a problem for competitors because it was challenging for them to match or beat these prices while maintaining profitability. The author's personal financial situation influenced this pricing strategy because they were poor at the time. This caused them to perceive $300 a month as a lot of money, leading them to price their product lower than they might have if they had a better understanding of what businesses typically paid for such services. This lack of knowledge inadvertently led to a competitive pricing strategy.",,0.716721002936977,0.99999999995,0.6666666666666666,1

 'After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\n\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn\'t that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don\'t I become rich? Then I\'ll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I\'d been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I\'d seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.\n\nIf I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can\'t honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn\'t want to be online, and still don\'t, not the fancy ones. That\'s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.\n\nThen some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we\'d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an ""internet storefront"" was something we already knew how to build.\n\nSo in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we\'d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores â\x80\x94 in Lisp, of course.\n\nWe were working out of Robert\'s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we\'d never have to write anything to run on users\' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we\'d serve them from. Users wouldn\'t need anything more than a browser.\n\nThis kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn\'t clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn\'t need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.\n\nWe started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle\'s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator\'s. We knew founders needed something like this, because we\'d needed it ourselves.']","The author's lack of business knowledge led them to make decisions that ultimately contributed to the success of Viaweb. For instance, when they first decided to put art galleries online, they didn't realize how difficult it would be to sell this idea to galleries. However, as they began working on this project, they gained valuable experience and eventually realized that creating online stores was a more viable business opportunity.

In particular, the author's lack of knowledge about writing Windows software initially led them to try building an online store builder on Unix. This decision allowed Robert to write a shopping cart, while the author wrote a new site generator for stores in Lisp. As they worked on this project, they had an epiphany that running the software on the server and letting users control it by clicking on links would be more efficient. This idea led them to create a web app that could be controlled through the browser, which eventually became the core of Viaweb's success.

In this way, the author's lack of business knowledge and experience inadvertently led them to focus on creating software that was server-based and user-friendly, rather than client-heavy and complex. This approach ultimately contributed to the success of Viaweb and allowed it to become a pioneering force in e-commerce.","The author's lack of business knowledge inadvertently contributed to the success of Viaweb in several ways. First, the author and his team set the price of their service low, charging $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This was not a strategic decision based on market research or business acumen, but rather because they were poor and $300 seemed like a lot of money to them. This low price turned out to be a big attraction for customers and a competitive advantage over other businesses.

Second, the author's lack of understanding about scaling led them to do things that didn't scale, such as building stores for their users. While this seemed humiliating and counterintuitive at the time, it turned out to be beneficial as it helped them understand retail and how their software was used, and it also helped them acquire users.

Lastly, the author's lack of business knowledge led them to focus on the absolute number of users rather than the growth rate. While this was a mistake in the author's eyes, it turned out that their growth rate was fine and they were growing 7x a year, which is a good sign for a startup.",,0.5586497931056793,0.99999999995,0.8571428571428571,1

He believes that being part of a batch, which solves the isolation problem faced by founders, is better not just for the startups but also for the investors like himself. This perspective influenced his decision to create Y Combinator (YC), an accelerator program that funds startups in batches.

As a result, Viaweb, one of the startups incubated at YC, benefited from being part of a batch and receiving guidance from experienced founders. The author's growth-oriented approach led to Viaweb's rapid expansion and eventual success, eventually becoming Amazon.","The author believes that the growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. He learned that the absolute number of users is important for immediate revenue, but in the long term, a high growth rate will ensure the absolute number increases. He reflects that if he had understood this earlier, he would have advised himself not to stress and not to hire too many people, as the company was growing seven times a year and was on the path to profitability.

However, he did hire more people, influenced by investor expectations and the norms of startups during the Internet Bubble. This decision delayed the company's break-even point and left them dependent on investors. The author regrets this, describing the result as a mess. Despite the company being profitable and growing rapidly, the author felt the near-death experiences every few months due to financial stress.

Eventually, Yahoo bought Viaweb, which the author describes as a huge relief and a transition from rags to riches.

He mentions that leaving YC was not just about the financial gain, but also about leaving behind the structure and community that came with it.

As for his ambition towards painting, there is no mention of him ever having been interested in or pursuing painting as an art form. His interests and endeavors seem to have been focused on entrepreneurship and education, rather than the arts.","In the essay, the author describes a significant shift in his lifestyle after selling his company to Yahoo. Initially, he lived a grad student lifestyle, which didn't change much even after starting his company. However, after the sale to Yahoo, he experienced a sudden transition from rags to riches. He bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI, which he considered a luxury, and moved to California.

However, the following year was the least productive of his life. He was worn out from the stress of running Viaweb and struggled to adapt to Yahoo's work culture. Despite the wealth he had acquired, he felt unfulfilled and decided to leave Yahoo in the summer of 1999 to pursue his passion for painting.

Upon leaving Yahoo, he immediately started painting. However, he found that he lacked energy and ambition. He attributed part of this to his isolation in California, having bought a house in the Santa Cruz Mountains, far from any social connections. In desperation, he returned to New York, where he still had his old apartment.

Back in New York, he resumed his old life, but now he was rich. This wealth opened up new opportunities for him. He no longer had to walk everywhere; he could hail a taxi. He could afford to eat at charming little restaurants. His painting started to improve, and he began experimenting with new techniques.

However, despite the financial freedom, the author seemed to struggle with finding fulfillment and maintaining his ambition to paint. The transition from a grad student lifestyle to sudden wealth brought about new opportunities but also new challenges in his pursuit of his passion.",,0.7063579458374202,0.99999999995,1.0,1

The platform would allow people to engage in conversations and discussions on a wide range of topics, from technology to social issues.

The author suggests that this type of anonymous discussion forum could be beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, it would provide an outlet for people to share their thoughts and opinions without fear of retribution or judgment. This could lead to more open and honest discussions, where people feel comfortable sharing their true views on sensitive topics.

Secondly, the author believes that this type of platform could be a valuable resource for educating and informing people about various subjects. By allowing users to share articles and engage in conversations, the platform would create a sense of community and shared learning.

The author also mentions that they were surprised by the success of their early version of this concept, which attracted a large number of users and became a valuable source of ""deal flow"" for startup founders. This suggests that the idea had potential to become a widely-used resource in the tech industry.

Overall, the author's vision is for a web application that facilitates open and honest discussions on various topics, allowing people to share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment.","In the essay, the author discusses the idea of creating a web application for making web applications.

23,"The author mentions a new dialect of Lisp that he worked on, called Arc. What are some reasons he gives for why Lisp hackers often dream of building a new Lisp?","[""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\n\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?""
 ""It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.""]","The desire to create something perfect. It's a siren song that has lured many programmers into a life of endless tinkering and refinement. The author notes that every time he builds something, it's not quite right - whether it's an online store builder or a new language like Arc. This is why Lisp hackers often dream of building a new Lisp - to create the perfect dialect, one that combines elegance with power. But, as the author wryly observes, this quest for perfection can be a never-ending cycle, leading to a life of endless improvement and refinement.","The author mentions that Lisp hackers often dream of building a new Lisp partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects. Additionally, he suggests that Lisp hackers may have in their minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of.",,0.5783656189480199,0.99999999995,1.0,0

This experience likely influenced his perspective towards open source projects, as it may have given him insight into the importance of efficient compilation and execution. However, there is no direct mention of this work having an impact on his perspective towards open source projects.","In Paul Graham's essay, his work on the new dialect of Lisp, Arc, is significant as it represents his contribution to the open-source community. He had spent a considerable amount of time thinking about this new architecture and even attempted to write some of it. This experience proved to be very useful when he encountered startups working on parts of this new architecture after starting Y Combinator.

His work on Arc also reflects his perspective towards open source projects. He saw the potential of building a new Lisp, a dream shared by many Lisp hackers, due to its distinctive feature of having dialects and the idea of a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. This shows his belief in the continuous improvement and evolution of open source projects, and his willingness to contribute to this process.

Furthermore, his work on Arc and the subsequent feedback he received from the community may have influenced his perspective on the power of the internet as a platform for sharing ideas and knowledge. This is evident when he started publishing essays online and realized the potential of the web as a medium for publishing, which was not limited by the traditional constraints of print media.",,0.0,0.99999999995,0.625,0

In the past, essays were confined within physical pages, with limited reach and engagement. However, with the advent of digital platforms like Hacker News, the boundaries have expanded, allowing for a global audience and real-time discussion.

Paul Graham views this shift as an opportunity for future generations to engage with ideas in a more dynamic and interactive way. He notes that essays can now be shared widely, sparking conversations and debates among readers. This democratization of ideas has enabled a new level of engagement, where people can participate, respond, and build upon each other's thoughts.

Moreover, the digital era has also facilitated the discovery of new ideas and perspectives. Paul Graham mentions how his essays became a source of ""deal flow"" for startups, attracting a large number of applications for the Summer Founders Program. This highlights the potential for essays to serve as a catalyst for innovation and entrepreneurship, connecting readers with opportunities and resources.

In summary, Paul Graham sees the shift in publishing essays from the print era to the digital era as a positive development that has opened up new avenues for engagement, discovery, and interaction. He believes that this shift will have a profound impact on future generations of essayists and readers, enabling them to explore and share ideas in ways that were previously unimaginable.","In the essay, Paul Graham describes a significant shift in publishing essays from the print era to the digital era. During the print era, the channel for publishing essays was very narrow, with only a few officially anointed thinkers and specialists in their fields allowed to publish. The digital era, however, opened up the possibility for anyone to publish anything, a concept that Graham admits took him several years to fully comprehend.

Graham views this shift as a revolutionary change that allows for a whole new generation of essays. He acknowledges that it was surprising to realize that if he wrote something and put it on the web, anyone could read it. This realization led him to understand that there were so many essays that had never been written because there had been no way to publish them in the print era. Now, these essays could be written and published online.

Despite recognizing that online essays would be viewed as a marginal medium at first, Graham found this encouraging rather than discouraging. He saw the lack of prestige in online essays as a sign of something real to be discovered and a test of the right kind of motives. He warns against the danger of impure motives, such as the desire to impress people, and suggests that working on things that aren't prestigious can help avoid the most common type of wrong path.

In summary, Paul Graham views the shift from print to digital publishing as a liberating change that opens up new possibilities for essay writing. He sees it as an opportunity for new voices to be heard and new ideas to be shared, even if they initially lack prestige.",,0.6610465102256077,,0.8,1

This led him to cook up the idea of the Summer Founders Program, which was announced on his site, attracting 225 applications from undergrads and others who'd already graduated or were about to. The success of this initial batch, including companies like Reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear's Twitch, Aaron Swartz's open-access advocacy, and Sam Altman's future role as YC president, showed Graham that a well-curated startup program could be highly effective.

Key events in this process included:

1. The launch of the Summer Founders Program
2. The selection and funding of the first batch of startups
3. The success of these initial startups, which demonstrated the potential of the program

Individuals who played significant roles include:

1. Jessica Livingston - Graham's partner, who helped with the logistics of running YC and provided support for the founders.
2. Robert Morris - A key figure in shaping the deal for startup funding, providing insight into the benefits of batched investments.
3. Sam Altman - An early success story from the Summer Founders Program, whose future role as president of YC would solidify Graham's commitment to this path.

These events and individuals collectively influenced Paul Graham's decision to start an investment firm by demonstrating the effectiveness of a well-run startup program and providing valuable insights into what worked and who could be instrumental in its success.","In Paul Graham's essay, several key events and individuals influenced his decision to start an investment firm. 

One of the key individuals was Jessica Livingston, a woman he met at a party at his house. Jessica worked in marketing at a Boston investment bank and was compiling a book of interviews with startup founders. When she had to look for a new job due to financial problems at her bank, Paul began sharing his ideas about what needed to change in venture capital. Jessica's experience and insights from the startup world and her job search played a significant role in shaping their decision to start an investment firm.

Another key event was a talk Paul gave at the Harvard Computer Society on how to start a startup. During this talk, he shared his belief that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders. This talk made him realize that he should stop procrastinating about angel investing, a thought he had been entertaining since Yahoo bought his company.

Paul also mentions his friends Robert and Trevor, with whom he had been scheming about potential projects. Their shared history and desire to collaborate again influenced his decision to start an investment firm, with the idea that they could all work together on this new venture.

Finally, the frustration with the slow decision-making process of traditional venture capitalists (VCs) was a significant factor. This led to the decision to start their own investment firm, where they could implement their ideas and strategies. The lack of established angel investors to learn from in Boston in 2005 also played a role, as it forced them to make their own choices, some of which turned out to be novel.",,0.5035308680812922,,0.75,1

Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the ""YC GDP,"" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\'t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\'s intellectual curiosity.\n\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I\'d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\'s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe.']","The unique approach that Y Combinator took towards investing in startups was based on a combination of two factors. Firstly, they invested in batches of startups at once, which made things more convenient for them but also better for the startups. This approach solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. By being part of a batch, startups gained colleagues who understood their problems and could provide valuable advice.

Secondly, Y Combinator's investment deal was based on a combination of what they themselves had taken as investors ($10k for 10%) and what MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). They invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. This deal was considered fair because it was twice as good as the one they themselves had taken.

This approach differed from traditional VC firms and angel investors, who often made investments on an individual basis. Y Combinator's batch-based approach created a sense of community among their startups, with alumni dedicated to helping one another and current batch members getting initial customers from among their peers. This resulted in the startups becoming one another's customers, which was referred to jokingly as the ""YC GDP.""","Y Combinator, as described in Paul Graham's essay, took a unique approach towards investing in startups. Unlike traditional VC firms and angel investors, Y Combinator was not organized as a fund and was funded with their own money. This was different from VC firms which were organized companies making large investments, and angels who were individuals making smaller investments on the side. Y Combinator's plan was to make seed investments and also provide support to startups in ways that traditional investors didn't, such as helping them get set up as a company.

Another distinctive feature of Y Combinator was its batch model. They would fund a group of startups all at once, twice a year, and then spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. This was discovered by accident due to their lack of experience as investors. They saw it as a way to gain experience by funding a bunch of startups at once, which was not a common practice among traditional investors.

An example of this approach in action was the Summer Founders Program, where they invited undergrads to start startups instead of taking up temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. This program resulted in a surprising number of applications, including from people who had already graduated or were about to. From these, they selected 8 groups to fund, including future successful companies like Reddit and Twitch. This shows how Y Combinator's unique approach allowed them to discover and invest in promising startups at an early stage.",,0.6084561730931479,,0.7777777777777778,1

However, the actual inception and initial implementation of the program are not explicitly described in this particular essay.

Instead, I can provide information on the early days of Paul Graham's entrepreneurial endeavors, as described in his essay. In 1995, Robert Morris and Paul Graham started working on software to build online stores. They initially planned to create desktop software for Windows but later shifted their focus to creating a web application that could be controlled through a browser. This marked an important turning point in their journey towards developing the concept of ""web apps.""

While there is no specific information about the Summer Founders Program, I can tell you that the essay highlights Paul Graham's experiences as a founder and his eventual involvement with Y Combinator.","In Paul Graham's essay, the inception of the Summer Founders Program (SFP) came about as a way for Graham and his partners to gain experience as investors. They decided to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and spend three months focusing intensively on helping them. The idea was to organize a summer program where undergraduates would start startups instead of getting temporary jobs at tech companies. The building Graham owned in Cambridge was used as headquarters, and weekly dinners and talks by startup experts were organized.

The SFP was announced on Graham's site, inviting undergraduates to apply. Surprisingly, they received 225 applications, many from people who had already graduated or were about to graduate. They invited about 20 of these groups for in-person interviews and selected 8 to fund.

The first batch of the SFP included notable participants who made significant contributions to the tech industry. This included the founders of Reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear who later founded Twitch, Aaron Swartz who helped write the RSS spec and became a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman who later became the second president of Y Combinator. Graham notes that the success of the first batch was not entirely due to luck, implying their selection and support process was effective.",,0.0,0.99999999995,0.8571428571428571,0

 ""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\n\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled.

How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren\'t they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I\'m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don\'t already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\n\n[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\n\n[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs\' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\n\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\n\nHere\'s an interesting point, though: you can\'t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\n\n[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn\'t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\n\nI picked orange as our color partly because it\'s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\n\n[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally.

At that point, YC did become a fund for a couple years, starting in 2009. However, after Heroku got bought, they had enough money to go back to being self-funded.

It's implied that the founder was initially approached to take on an institutional role, but instead chose to revert back to a more informal and entrepreneurial structure. This decision allowed YC to maintain its independence and continue to operate in a way that aligned with its original mission and values.

The specific individuals who were considered or ultimately took on leadership roles at this time are not mentioned. However, the essay suggests that the transition was driven by a desire to preserve the unique culture and approach of Y Combinator, rather than adopting more traditional or institutional forms of governance.","The transition of leadership at Y Combinator was described as a thoughtful and gradual process. Initially, Jessica was asked if she wanted to be president, but she declined the offer. The team then decided to approach Sam Altman for the role. The decision to recruit Sam was part of a larger plan to ensure the longevity of Y Combinator. The founders believed that for YC to last a long time, it couldn't be controlled by the founders, hence the need for a change in leadership. Sam initially declined the offer as he wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. However, after persistent efforts, Sam finally agreed to take over as president in October 2013. The transition was gradual, with Sam taking over more responsibilities towards the end of 2013. This was partly to allow him to learn the job and partly because the author was focused on his mother, whose cancer had returned.",0.7272727272727273,0.642844736834682,0.99999999995,0.8333333333333334,1
34,"In the context of the essay, why did the author decide to step away from YC and start painting? What led him to eventually stop painting and return to writing essays and working on Lisp?","['All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn\'t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\n\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven\'t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don\'t know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we\'d have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\n\nThere weren\'t any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers\' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn\'t happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.\n\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief â\x80\x94 hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 â\x80\x94 that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.\n\nI had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn\'t make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose ""Artificial Intelligence."" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.\n\nI applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I\'d visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who\'d invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\n\nI don\'t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that\'s told ""the dog is sitting on the chair"" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.\n\nWhat these programs really showed was that there\'s a subset of natural language that\'s a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.\n\nSo I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It\'s scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there\'s nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn\'t published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.'

 ""I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\n\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives.

I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing.

Its core is defined by writing an interpreter in itself, which gives it power and elegance that other languages can't match. This distinct approach makes Lisp stand out from other programming languages, with its origins as a model of computation providing a unique foundation for its evolution into a programming language.","In the essay, the author describes Lisp as a programming language that originated as a model of computation, which gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. This unique origin is what initially attracted the author to Lisp during his college years.

The author explains that Lisp was invented by John McCarthy in 1960, and its core is defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended to be a programming language in the ordinary sense, but rather a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. The minimum set of predefined operators needed to write an interpreter for a language in itself is what defines the Lisp that McCarthy invented.

However, McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could be used to program computers until his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point, Lisp began to be used as a programming language in the ordinary sense.

The author notes that McCarthy's original Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions and was missing many features that are desirable in a programming language. These features had to be added later, but they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach because it wouldn't have been feasible at the time due to the limitations of computers.

The author concludes by suggesting that with the power of modern computers, it would now be possible to continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach to define a complete programming language. As long as every change made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, one could, in principle, end up with a complete language that retained the unique qualities of Lisp.",,0.0,0.99999999995,0.6666666666666666,1

 'We\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We\'d all have dinner there once a week â\x80\x94 on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays â\x80\x94 and after dinner we\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get ""deal flow,"" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who\'d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we\'d intended.\n\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\'s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the ""YC GDP,"" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\'t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\'s intellectual curiosity.\n\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I\'d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\'s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe.']","The ability to navigate complex decisions is a skill that must be honed. In professional settings, the choices we make are often influenced by our personal experiences and level of self-awareness. Consider Paul Graham's experience with YC. He initially intended for it to be a part-time endeavor but found himself becoming increasingly absorbed in its growth. This shift was likely driven by his ability to recognize the value and potential of the project, which is a key aspect of effective decision-making.

Similarly, when Graham started working on a new version of Arc, he wrote Hacker News to test its capabilities. This was not an accident; rather, it reflects his willingness to experiment and learn from his experiences. By doing so, he was able to identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions about how to proceed.

These examples illustrate the importance of personal experiences and introspection in professional decision-making. They demonstrate that effective leaders are often those who can reflect on their own thought processes and experiences to inform their choices. This self-awareness enables them to navigate complex decisions with greater ease and make more informed, effective choices.","In Paul Graham's essay, he reflects on his own decision-making process, demonstrating how personal experiences and introspection can greatly influence professional choices. He begins by asking himself how he had chosen what to work on in the past, indicating that he is drawing on his personal experiences to guide his future decisions. This introspective process leads him to a long and messy answer, suggesting that his decision-making process is complex and influenced by various factors from his life experiences.

For example, he mentions that he wrote an essay for himself to answer the question of how he chooses what to work on. This indicates that he uses writing as a tool for introspection, allowing him to articulate and understand his thoughts and experiences better. This introspective process can lead to surprising insights, as it did for Graham when he found his answer to be longer and messier than expected.

Furthermore, he thought that his introspective journey might be interesting and encouraging to others with similarly messy lives. This suggests that he believes his personal experiences and the insights gained from introspection can be valuable not only for his own decision-making process but also for others in similar situations.

In the notes, Graham also shares various personal experiences, from his time living in Florence (note 3) to his experiences with software and online publishing (notes 9, 10, 11). These experiences likely influenced his professional decisions, demonstrating how personal experiences can shape our professional lives.

In conclusion, Graham's essay illustrates how personal experiences and introspection can influence decision-making in professional life. By reflecting on past experiences and using introspection to understand our thoughts and feelings, we can gain valuable insights that guide our professional choices.",,0.6379050717233441,0.99999999995,1.0,1

The author mentions Interleaf, a company that had impressive technology but was ultimately crushed by Moore's Law, which led to the exponential growth in the power of commodity processors. This anecdote serves as a metaphor for the rapidly changing landscape of technology and the need for adaptability.

In the context of the essay, this note is significant because it highlights the author's experience with Interleaf, which shares similarities with his own experiences with companies that failed to keep pace with technological advancements. The author's mention of Interleaf's impressive technology but ultimate demise serves as a reminder that even innovative ideas can fall victim to the rapid evolution of technology.

This note contributes to the overall theme or message of the essay by emphasizing the importance of being able to adapt and evolve in response to changing circumstances. The author's experiences with Interleaf, combined with his own reflections on his own successes and failures, serve as a cautionary tale about the need for innovation and adaptability in an ever-changing world.

Furthermore, this note also touches on the idea that even the best ideas can become obsolete if they fail to keep pace with technological advancements. This serves as a reminder that innovation is not just about coming up with new ideas, but also about being able to execute them effectively and adapt to changing circumstances.

This is evident when advanced civilizations, like space aliens, would likely be familiar with certain concepts, such as the Pythagorean theorem or even Lisp programming languages. However, this familiarity doesn't necessarily mean they wouldn't need additional aspects like numbers and input/output functionality.

In a similar vein, historical technologies that were once revolutionary might continue to exert influence on our practices, even if their initial constraints no longer apply. For instance, early computer systems may have been cumbersome, but the concept of interactive operating systems has continued to evolve and shape modern computing practices. This phenomenon highlights how customs can endure, shaping our actions and decisions, often without us even realizing it.","Yes, Paul Graham discusses the concept of customs and their lasting influence in the essay. He uses the example of venture capital (VC) practices and the publishing of essays to illustrate this point. 

In the case of VC practices, he explains that these customs were formed during a time when startups were expensive to start and rare. However, even though startups can now be cheap and common, the customs of VCs still reflect the constraints of the old world. 

Similarly, he talks about how the customs of publishing essays still reflect the constraints of the print era, despite the advent of online publishing. 

He further argues that independent-minded individuals, who are less influenced by these outdated customs, have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change. This is because these customs are more likely to be obsolete in such rapidly changing environments.",,0.6929692317825077,0.99999999995,0.8571428571428571,1

 ""It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.""]","In his discussion of invented versus discovered knowledge, Paul Graham uses the analogy of a child teaching their parents something they never knew existed. He explains that just as the child didn't invent the concept, but rather discovered it through their own experiences and exploration, so too is knowledge often discovered, not invented.

He illustrates this point by suggesting that an advanced alien civilization might arrive on Earth and teach humans concepts like the Pythagorean theorem or Lisp, which they themselves had never ""invented"" in the sense of creating from scratch. Instead, they would be presenting to humans a piece of knowledge that was already ""out there"", waiting to be discovered.

In this way, Graham argues that many of the most significant advances in human understanding are not the result of deliberate invention, but rather the discovery of pre-existing truths and concepts that were always available to us.","In the essay, Paul Graham uses the concept of an advanced alien civilization to illustrate the idea of invented versus discovered knowledge. He posits that any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean theorem, suggesting that this knowledge is universal and thus discovered, not invented. He also believes, though with less certainty, that these aliens would know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper. This implies that the Lisp language, like the Pythagorean theorem, is a discovered knowledge that transcends human invention. He further speculates that there might be no limit to the language that might be known to these aliens, suggesting the possibility of more discovered knowledge.",,0.6455057421388688,0.99999999995,1.0,1
43,Paul Graham mentions his experience of leaving YC and no longer working with Jessica. How does he describe this experience and what does it reveal about his personal and professional relationship with Jessica?,"['But when the software is an online store builder and you\'re hosting the stores, if you don\'t have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We\'d had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn\'t know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn\'t an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants\' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren\'t they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I\'m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don\'t already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\n\n[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\n\n[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs\' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\n\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\n\nHere\'s an interesting point, though: you can\'t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\n\n[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn\'t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\n\nI picked orange as our color partly because it\'s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\n\n[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.\n\n[15] I\'ve never liked the term ""deal flow,"" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it\'s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.\n\n[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.\n\n[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum, you\'re assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous.
